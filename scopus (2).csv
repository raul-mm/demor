So-called “mobile health” has the potential to participate in the transformation of health care and to increase its quality and effectiveness. It is not intended to replace health professionals, but is a supportive tool for the management and delivery of health care. The development of new information and communication technologies (5G, IPv6, cloud, cyber-security, big data, and artificial intelligence) can enable personalized, accurate, preventive, predictive, and participatory medicine (“medicine 5P”). All this will allow the diagnosis and therapeutic or preventive measures to be adapted in a more individualized way. Moreover, the digitization of medicine, through the Internet of Things (IOC) and, in particular, wearables, it allows the patient himself to be in the leading role by putting his health information permanently in the hands of the health professionals and at the same time participating in the control of his health (self-control). © 2022, Ediciones Laborum, S.L..

Setting and Sample Population: Seventy-five faculty, scholars, private practitioners, industry, residents and students met at the UCLA Arrowhead Lodge on 6–9 November 2022 for networking, scientific presentations and facilitated discussions. Thirty-three speakers provided state-of-the-art, evidence-based scientific and perspective updates in craniofacial and orthodontic-related fields. The overall format included an Education Innovation Award Faculty Development Career Enrichment (FaCE) workshop focused on faculty career development, three lunch and learns, keynote or short talks and poster presentations. Material and Methods: The 2022 COAST Conference was organized thematically to include (a) genes, cells and environment in craniofacial development and abnormalities; (b) precision modulation of tooth movement, retention and facial growth; (c) applications of artificial intelligence in craniofacial health; (d) precision approaches to Sleep Medicine, OSA and TMJ therapies; and (e) precision technologies and appliances. Results: The collective advances in orthodontics and science represented in the manuscripts of this issue fulfil our goal of laying solid foundations for personalized orthodontics. Participants elevated the need for stronger industry-academic research partnerships to leverage knowledge gained from large datasets with treatment approaches and outcomes; systematizing the potential of big data including through multi-omics and artificial intelligence approaches; refining the genotype: phenotype correlation to create biotechnology that will rescue inherited dental and craniofacial defects; evolving studies of tooth movement, sleep apnoea and TMD treatment to accurately measure dysfunction and treatment successes; and maximizing the integration of newer orthodontic devices and digital workflows. Conclusions: Technological advances combined with those in biomedicine and machine learning are rapidly changing the delivery of health care including that in orthodontics. These advances promise to lead to enhanced customization, efficiencies and outcomes of patient care in routine orthodontic problems and in severe craniofacial problems, OSA and TMD. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

There has been a groundswell of companies developing tools for improving patient care utilizing healthcare data, but procedural specialties, like surgery, have lagged behind in benefitting from data-based innovations, given the lack of data that is well structured. While many companies are attempting to innovate in the surgical field, some have encountered difficulties around collecting surgical data, given its complex nature. As there is no standardized way in which to interact with healthcare systems to purchase these data, the authors attempt to characterize the various ways in which surgical data are collected and shared. By surveying and conducting interviews with various surgical technology companies, at least 3 different methods to collect surgical data were identified. From this information, the authors conclude that an attempt to outline best practices should be undertaken that benefits all stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2021.","artificial intelligence; healthcare data; MedTech; purchasing healthcare data; surgical data science; surgical innovation; surgical robotics; surgical technology","Artificial Intelligence; Humans; artificial intelligence; data science; health care system; health data; human; interview; purchasing; review; robotics; surgical technology","","","","","","","The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data, The Economist; Putha P., Tadepalli M., Reddy B., Et al., Can artificial intelligence reliably report chest x-rays?: Radiologist validation of an algorithm trained on 2.3 million X-rays, (2019); Kario K., Shimbo D., Tomitani N., Kanegae H., Schwartz J.E., Williams B., The first study comparing a wearable watch‐type blood pressure monitor with a conventional ambulatory blood pressure monitor on in‐office and out‐of‐office settings, J Clin Hypertens, 22, 2, pp. 135-141, (2020); Wall J., Krummel T., The digital surgeon: How big data, automation, and artificial intelligence will change surgical practice, J Pediatr Surg, 55, pp. 47-50, (2020); Maier-Hein L., Vedula S.S., Speidel S., Et al., Surgical data science for next-generation interventions, Nat Biomed Eng, 1, 9, pp. 691-696, (2017); Maier-Hein L., Eisenmann M., Feldmann C., Et al., Surgical data science: A consensus perspective, (2018); Vedula S.S., Hager G.D., Surgical data science: The new knowledge domain, Innov Surg Sci, 2, 3, pp. 109-121, (2017); Lanfranco A.R., Castellanos A.E., Desai J.P., Meyers W.C., Robotic surgery: A current perspective, Ann Surg, 239, 1, pp. 14-21, (2004); Sheetz K.H., Claflin J., Dimick J.B., Trends in the adoption of robotic surgery for common surgical procedures, JAMA Network Open, 3, (2020); Hannaford B., Rosen J., Friedman D.W., Et al., Raven-II: An open platform for surgical robotics research, IEEE Trans Biomed Eng, 60, 4, pp. 954-959, (2013)","A.T.

Construction job sites are increasingly dangerous with historically low levels of innovations and adaptation to change. Construction workers are required to perform repetitive manual tasks involving heavy lifting, bending, twisting, reaching overhead or away from the body and working under generally unfavorable conditions. Construction companies have a moral and legal responsibility to ensure working environments for their workers that do not present a threat to their health, safety and general wellbeing. The purpose of this study is to explore how the application of disruptive AI technologies could improve construction workers’ wellbeing and safety on the job site. This paper reviewed previous studies on the application of AI on construction workers’ wellbeing such as, for example, Weak AI, Strong AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Big Data. Furthermore, keywords such as, for example, Construction, Workers, Health and Safety, Artificial Intelligence and Wellbeing were used to search online databases. The findings of this study indicated that the integration of AI on construction job sites may be used to prevent negative and health and safety prejudicial occurrences from happening by monitoring and tracking the workforce and their construction activities using, for example, applications (apps), wearables or emotional wellbeing tools. Moreover, the complex industry could benefit from machine learning to bank an unlimited amount of data for better overall health and safety performance. Based on the findings, the benefits of AI technologies imbued with machine learning, have a far-reaching impact than the negatives as traditional health and safety systems continue to fail to eliminate construction accidents. Therefore, the adoption of AI could help improve construction workers wellbeing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Construction workers; Health and safety; Machine learning; Wellbeing","Accident prevention; Construction industry; Deep learning; Health; Learning systems; Occupational risks; Wearable technology; AI Technologies; Condition; Construction job sites; Construction workers; Health and safety; Level of innovation; Machine-learning; Multi arrays; South Africa; Wellbeing; Health risks","","","","","Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg, FNR","The authors much acknowledge the support of the National Research Fund","Delponte L., European artificial intelligence leadership, The Path for an Integrated Vision, (2018); Eaves S., Gyi D., Gibb A., Facilitating healthy ageing in construction: Stakeholder views, Procedia Manuf, 3, pp. 4681-4688, (2015); Esmaeili B., Hallowell M., Diffusion of safety innovations in the construction industry, J Constr Eng Manage, 138, 8, pp. 955-963, (2012); Commission E., Communication on Artificial Intelligence for Europe, (2018); Hinze J., Teizer J., Visibility-related fatalities related to construction equipment, Saf Sci, 49, pp. 709-718, (2011); Hutter M., One decade of universal artificial intelligence, Theor Found Artif Gen Intell, 4, pp. 67-88, (2012); Li R.Y., Generation x and y’s demand for homeownership in Hong Kong, Pacific Rim Real Estate J, 21, pp. 15-36, (2015); John M., Minsky Martin L., Rochester N., Shannon C.E., A proposal for the Dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence, Online, (1955); Moore P.V., The threat of physical and psychosocial violence and harassment in digitalized work.

Both artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have the potential to enhance our understanding of data and therefore our ability to accurately diagnose and treat patients. By leveraging these technologies and processes, we can uncover associations between a person’s genomic makeup and their health, identify biomarkers associated with diseases, fine-tune patient selection for clinical trials, reduce costs, and accelerate drug discovery and vaccine development. Although real-world data pose challenges in terms of collection, representation, and missing or inaccurate data sets, the integration of precision medicine into healthcare is critical. Clearly, precision medicine can benefit from health information innovations that empower decision-making at the patient level. Healthcare fusion is an example of an innovative framework and process [K Zhai et al. ECKM 2022, 20(3), pp. 179–192]. Data science and process improvement are also expected to play a role in resource planning and operational efficiency for optimal patient-centered care. Driving this transformation are advances in ‘omics’ technologies, digital devices, and imaging capabilities, along with an arsenal of powerful analytics tools working across a multitude of institutions and stakeholders. Encompassing this entire ecosystem, medicine will be evidence-based and driven by three key components: (1) Data curation through clinical diagnostics and behavioral apps that capture health and disease states; (2) Individualized solutions driven by advanced data analytics and personalized therapies; and (3) Business models that deliver value and incentivize growth. The aim of this paper is to present a novel conceptual framework to leverage AI and enhance information flow to serve the patient as per components one and two. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; big data; clinical workflow; cloud computing; healthcare fusion; IMS; information management system; machine learning; medical records; patient-centered care; population health; precision medicine; precision prescription; ROBIN","","","","","","Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar Health Sciences Library","The authors want to thank their respective institutions for their continued support.

These challenges are similar in different countries of the region and transcend national borders. The increasing digital transformation of health care holds promise of more precise interventions, improved health outcomes, increased efficiency, and ultimately reduced health-care costs. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the adoption of digital health tools is in early stages and the quality of cancer registries, electronic health records, and structured databases are problematic. Cancer research and innovation in the region are limited due to inadequate academic resources and translational research is almost fully dependent on public funding. Regulatory complexity and extended timelines jeopardise the potential improvement in participation in international studies. Emerging technologies, artificial intelligence, big data, and cancer research represent an opportunity to address the health-care challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean collectively, by optimising national capacities, sharing and comparing best practices, and transferring scientific and technical capabilities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Biomedical Research; Caribbean Region; Digital Technology; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Latin America; Neoplasms; Precision Medicine; adoption; artificial intelligence; big data; cancer control; cancer registry; cancer research; cancer staging; Caribbean; clinical research; controlled study; electronic health record; funding; health care cost; human; personalized medicine; poverty; review; translational research; Caribbean; medical research; neoplasm; personalized medicine; South and Central America","","","","","AB Science; Abraxis Biosciences; FICMAC; Foundation for Clinical and Applied Cancer Research; Henlius Biotech; Pharma Mar; Polyphor; Amgen; Bristol-Myers Squibb, BMS; Eli Lilly and Company; Pfizer; AstraZeneca; Bayer; GlaxoSmithKline, GSK; Merck; Novartis; Roche; Sanofi; AbbVie; Boehringer Ingelheim; BioMarin Pharmaceutical; Merck KGaA; Merck Sharp and Dohme, MSD; Les Laboratories Pierre Fabre; Asana Biosciences; Daiichi-Sankyo; Eisai; Astellas Pharma; Servier; Ipsen","CHB reports institutional research grant from Pfizer, Pharma Mar, Polyphor, Henlius Biotech, Merck KGaA, Millennium, LEO Pharma, ImClone Systems, Exelixis, Medivation, Asana Biosciences, AB Science, Abraxis Biosciences, Daiichi Sankyo, Bristol Myers Squibb, BioMarin, Astellas Pharma, AbbVie, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Merrimack, Mylan, Taiho Pharmaceutical, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline, Roche/Genentech, Lilly, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis, AstraZeneca, and Amgen; advisory board consulting from Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi, Lilly, Zodiac, AstraZeneca, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Bayer, Eisai, Roche/Genentech, Pfizer, Novartis, and GlaxoSmithKline; and stocks from MedSIR, Biomarker, and Tummi, outside the submitted work; he declares no relevant conflicts of interests related to this Series paper.

This is because the confluence of these fields, whose methodologies have experienced explosive growth in the last few years, promises to solve some of the more challenging problems in sustainable and healthy nutrition, i.e., integrating food and behavioral-based dietary guidelines. Focusing here primarily on nutrition and health, we discuss what kind of methodological shift is needed to open current disciplinary borders to the methods, languages, and knowledge of the digital era and a system thinking approach. Specifically, we advocate for the adoption of interdisciplinary, complex-systems-based research to tackle the huge challenge of dealing with an evolving interdependent system in which there are multiple scales—from the metabolome to the population level—, heterogeneous and—more often than not— incomplete data, and population changes subject to many behavioral and environmental pressures. To illustrate the importance of this methodological innovation we focus on the consumption aspects of nutrition rather than production, but we recognize the importance of system-wide studies that involve both these components of nutrition. We round off the paper by outlining some specific research directions that would make it possible to find new correlations and, possibly, causal relationships across scales and to answer pressing questions in the area of sustainable and healthy nutrition.

The sensitive nature of health care data presents several crucial issues such as privacy, security, interoperability, and reliability that must be addressed in any health care data management system. However, most of the current health care systems are still facing major obstacles and are lacking in some of these areas. This is where decentralized, secure, and scalable databases, most notably blockchains, play critical roles in addressing these requirements without compromising security, thereby attracting considerable interest within the health care community. A blockchain can be maintained and widely distributed using a large network of nodes, mostly computers, each of which stores a full replica of the data. A blockchain protocol is a set of predefined rules or procedures that govern how the nodes interact with the network, view, verify, and add data to the ledger. Objective: In this article, we aim to explore blockchain technology, its framework, current applications, and integration with other innovations, as well as opportunities in diverse areas of health care and clinical research, in addition to clarifying its future impact on the health care ecosystem. We also elucidate 2 case studies to instantiate the potential role of blockchains in health care. Methods: To identify related existing work, terms based on Medical Subject Headings were used. We included studies focusing mainly on health care and clinical research and developed a functional framework for implementation and testing with data. The literature sources for this systematic review were PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane library, in addition to a preliminary search of IEEE Xplore. Results: The included studies demonstrated multiple framework designs and various implementations in health care including chronic disease diagnosis, management, monitoring, and evaluation. We found that blockchains exhibit many promising applications in clinical trial management such as smart-contract application, participant-controlled data access, trustless protocols, and data validity. Electronic health records (EHRs), patient-centered interoperability, remote patient monitoring, and clinical trial data management were found to be major areas for blockchain usage, which can become a key catalyst for health care innovations. Conclusions: The potential benefits of blockchains are limitless; however, concrete data on long-term clinical outcomes based on blockchains powered and supplemented by AI and IoT are yet to be obtained. Nonetheless, implementing blockchains as a novel way to integrate EHRs nationwide and manage common clinical problems in an algorithmic fashion has the potential for improving patient outcomes, health care experiences, as well as the overall health and well-being of individuals. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

We executed a consensus-based international strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Four general coordinators, six field coordinators, and 12 experts participated in the study. SWOTs were provided for the following fields: neurogastroenterology, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and upper gastrointestinal diseases; inflammatory bowel disease; pancreatology and biliary diseases; endoscopy; gastrointestinal oncology; and hepatology. The GASTROSWOT analysis highlights the following in the current state of the field of gastroenterology: the incidence and complexity of several gastrointestinal diseases, including malignancies, are increasing; the COVID-19 pandemic has affected patient care on several levels; and with the advent of technical innovations in gastroenterology, a well trained workforce and strategic planning are required to optimise health-care utilisation. The analysis calls attention to the following in the future of gastroenterology: artificial intelligence and the use of big data will speed up discovery and smarter health-care provision in the field; the growth and diversification of gastroenterological specialties will improve specialised care for patients, but could promote fragmentation of care and health system inefficiencies; and furthermore, thoughtful planning is needed to reach an effective balance between the need for subspecialists and the value of general gastroenterology services. © 2022","","Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Gastroenterology; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Pandemics; acute pancreatitis; alcohol consumption; alcohol liver disease; analysis; artificial intelligence; awareness; Barrett esophagus; biliary tract disease; biliary tract endoscopy; biliopancreatic bypass; cancer palliative therapy; cancer screening; cancer therapy; carbon footprint; cardiology; cholelithiasis; chronic pancreatitis; colon cancer screening; colorectal cancer; consensus; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; diagnostic accuracy; digestive system cancer; digestive system function disorder; dysplasia; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; endoscopic submucosal dissection; endoscopic ultrasonography; endoscopy; eosinophilic esophagitis; esophagus cancer; follow up; gallbladder drainage; gastroenterologist; gastroenterology; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal motility; gastrointestinal oncology; health care; health service; hepatitis C; hepatology; human; inflammatory bowel disease; intestine flora; lifestyle; liver cell carcinoma; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; malignant neoplasm; manometry; metabolic fatty liver; microbiome; minimally invasive surgery; nephrology; nerve block; neurogastroenterology; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; opportunity cost; pancreas cancer; pancreas cyst; pancreatology; pancreatoscopy; pathogenesis; pathology; peroral endoscopic myotomy; pyloromyotomy; radiology; randomized controlled trial (topic); rectum cancer; Review; risk factor; strength; SWOT analysis; upper gastrointestinal disease; virus hepatitis; weakness; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal endoscopy; pandemic","","","","","Spanish Association of Gastroenterology for endorsing the project; Gilead Sciences; AbbVie","Funding text 1: The GASTROSWOT team thanks the Spanish Association of Gastroenterology for endorsing the project.; Funding text 2: EdM is a consultant for Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Abbott, and Mylan.

Digital technologies, which are electronic tools, systems, devices, and resources that generate, store or process data, are known to have impacted health care. They have simplified access to health, lower cost of diagnosis and treatments, and improved communication between doctors and patients in the areas of electronic health (eHealth), storage of and access to medical information and data, generating and storing of big data, improving lines of communication between patients and their doctors, electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine and telehealth, mobile health (mHealth), online learning (eLearning), health applications, and drones. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the digital health transformation has increased by leap and bound and would likely play a vital role in fighting current and future pandemics by enabling fundamental shifts in medical care, both during the pandemic and in the aftermath. Despite the gains from digital innovation in health care, they did not come without challenges, which are likely to be more with future advancements in digital technology and health. Virtually all technological tools in health care are associated with challenges, limitations or drawbacks. Notable areas of challenges are related to societal problems, ethical issues, connected health solutions, artificial intelligence, and genomics in precision medicine. The challenges are currently being addressed through digital health research, which, hopefully, would proffer lasting solutions. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.","Advancement;

Digital transformation is the reimagining of business in the digital age. A radical rethinking of how an organization uses technology, people, and processes to fundamentally change business performance is referred to as digital transformation. Digital transformation, on the other hand, starts and ends with how you think about and engage with customers. With digitalization on our side, we have the opportunity to reimagine how we do business, how we engage our customers as we move from paper to spreadsheets to smart applications for managing our businesses. Digital technology has pervaded nearly every industry, and concepts such as Big Data, Internet of Things, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and digital transformation now figure prominently in discussions of current and future trends. In particular digital transformation refers to the idea of extensive restructuring of operations in organizations, business agencies, and other entities to incorporate technological innovations that completely reshape the approach to the processes. Although interest in digital transformation has recently extended from practitioners to scholars, the academic literature on digital transformation is still rather limited. This literature review was aimed at mapping out existing scholarly resources on digital transformation to provide a baseline understanding of the areas covered, define the extents of adoption of technology, and understand future trends in digitization. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Big Data; Boolean; Business; Challenges; Data; Digital framework; Digital processes; Digital transformation; Health services; Industry 4.0; IOT; PRISMA; Process; Technologies; Technology; User experience; UX; Variables; Web","","","","","","","","Afonasova M., Digital transformation of the entrepreneurship: Challenges and prospects, Journal of Entrepreneurship Education, 21, 25, pp. 1-7, (2018); Agarwal R., Gao G., Desroches C., Jha A., The digital transformation of healthcare: Current status and the road ahead, Information Systems Research, 21, 4, pp. 796-809, (2010); Al-Ruithe M., Benkhelifa E., Hameed K., Key issues for embracing the cloud computing to adopt a digital transformation: A study of Saudi public sector, Procedia Computer Science, 130, pp. 1037-1043, (2018); Benjamin K., Potts W., Digital Transformation in Government: Lessons for Digital Health?

However, in recent years it has been faced with fundamental questions about its future. This report is an extension of the one published in 2018 by the National Academies of Medicine and Pharmacy and unfortunately only confirms a strong deterioration at all levels. The public authorities do not assume their role of regulator, thus allowing the excessive financialization of medical biology to increase considerably and lead to disproportionate groupings of Medical Biology Laboratories (LBM), destructive and sources of health risks. The result is that city LBMs, whose poor territorial distribution is already known, are gradually becoming simple sampling sites, with patients then finding themselves alone, often anxious, with their results transmitted via the internet without interpretation. Furthermore, although progress in the field of medical biology is incredible and should constitute a major center of attraction for young people, the disaffection of the discipline is total and worrying. Finally, innovation, in the context of current technological progress: connected devices, artificial intelligence and big data, represents a major challenge for the future. Here again nothing is done, or almost, while the sites are immense. After these alarming findings, the report will end with a series of recommendations aimed at optimizing the entry of LBMs into a new era. © 2022 l'Académie nationale de médecine; La biologie médicale est un maillon essentiel de la prise en charge des patients, tant pour le diagnostic et le suivi des maladies que pour certaines avancées thérapeutiques. Elle est toutefois, depuis quelques années, confrontée à des questions fondamentales concernant son avenir. Le présent rapport s'inscrit dans le prolongement de celui publié en 2018 par les Académies nationales de médecine et de pharmacie et ne fait malheureusement que conforter une forte dégradation à tous les niveaux. Les pouvoirs publics n'assument pas leur rôle de régulateur, permettant ainsi que la financiarisation à outrance de la biologie médicale s'amplifie considérablement et conduise à des regroupements démesurés des Laboratoires de biologie médicale (LBM), destructeurs et sources de risques sanitaires. Le résultat est que les LBM de ville, dont on connaît déjà la mauvaise répartition territoriale, deviennent progressivement de simples sites de prélèvement, les patients se retrouvant alors seuls, souvent angoissés, avec leurs résultats transmis par internet sans interprétation. Par ailleurs, bien que les progrès dans le domaine de la biologie médicale soient incroyables et devraient constituer un pôle d'attractivité majeur pour les jeunes, la désaffection de la discipline est totale et inquiétante. Enfin, l'innovation, dans le cadre des progrès technologiques actuels : dispositifs connectés, intelligence artificielle et mégadonnées (big data), représente un enjeu majeur pour l'avenir. Là encore rien n'est fait, ou presque, alors que les chantiers sont immenses. Après ces constatations alarmantes, le rapport se terminera par une série de recommandations visant à optimiser l'entrée des LBM dans une nouvelle ère. © 2022 l'Académie nationale de médecine","Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Big data; Big data; Big data; Big data; Financialization; Financialization; Financialization; Financialization; Financialization; Financiarisation; Financiarisation; Financiarisation; Financiarisation; Financiarisation; Innovation technologique; Innovation technologique; Innovation technologique; Innovation technologique; Innovation technologique; Intelligence artificielle; Intelligence artificielle; Intelligence artificielle; Intelligence artificielle; Intelligence artificielle; Laboratoire de biologie médicale; Laboratoire de biologie médicale; Laboratoire de biologie médicale; Laboratoire de biologie médicale; Laboratoire de biologie médicale; Medical biology laboratory; Medical biology laboratory; Medical biology laboratory; Medical biology laboratory; Medical biology laboratory; Mégadonnées (big data); Mégadonnées (big data); Mégadonnées (big data); Mégadonnées (big data); Mégadonnées (big data); Technological innovation; Technological innovation; Technological innovation; Technological innovation; Technological innovation","accreditation; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; big data; clinical laboratory; clinical research; continuing education; financial management; follow up; France; general hospital; genetic trait; health care; health practitioner; high throughput sequencing; hospital department; hospital laboratory; human; in vitro fertilization; information dissemination; investment; laboratory personnel; law; medical biology; medical biology laboratory; medical decision making; molecular biology; patient care; pension; personalized medicine; prescription; private hospital; private practice; private sector; professional knowledge; professional practice; public health; public hospital; reimbursement; retirement; self-testing","","","","","JET Energy Inc.; Nanortech, Inc.","The author acknowledges and thanks Gayle Verner and David Nagel for their editorial assistance, and significant suggestions and comments.

Typical interactions require applying comparative data analysis to huge repositories of genomic information for building new knowledge, taking advantage of the latest findings in applied genomics for healthcare. Powerful technology for data extraction and analysis is available, but broad use of the technology is hampered by the complexity of accessing such methods and tools.This work presents GeCoAgent, a big-data service for clinicians and biologists. GeCoAgent uses a dialogic interface, animated by a chatbot, for supporting the end-users' interaction with computational tools accompanied by multi-modal support. While the dialogue progresses, the user is accompanied in extracting the relevant data from repositories and then performing data analysis, which often requires the use of statistical methods or machine learning. Results are returned using simple representations (spreadsheets and graphics), while at the end of a session the dialogue is summarized in textual format.

In this sector called health tourism, intermediary organizations that can act on behalf of service recipients by directing them and providing service logistics play an important role. The destinations that can be determined in the alternatives offered by intermediary organizations while conducting research on behalf of the patient can be in the form of getting a better quality health service at a cheaper price, as well as depending on the technology in health services. The concept of Health 4.0, which is the use of next-generation technologies in healthcare services, is used in a wide range of areas from artificial intelligence to big data analytics; from Internet of Things technology to augmented reality. In countries that adapt to technological innovations, health infrastructure attracts a large number of tourists to the destination and creates a great source of income. Unlike other types of travel, health travel between countries may involve some special conditions. Although these conditions vary according to the components in the health tourism market, they can be effective in all decision processes since human health is in question. Intermediary organizations, which can operate in every market of health tourism, provide sectoral logistics as the first gateway to patients, especially in medical tourism. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Health 4.0; Health tourism; Intermediary institutions in health tourism; Medical tourism; Service providers in health tourism; Supplier businesses in health tourism; Technology 4.0","","","","","","","","Siemieniec R., Mente R., 600 V Power Device Technologies for Highly Efficient Power supplies,º in 2021 23Rd European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications; Akalin B., Sağlık Hizmetleri Ve Yönetiminde Yapay Zekâ, (2020); Akalin B., Veranyurt U., Sağlık hizmetleri ve yönetiminde yapay zekâ, Acta Infologica, 5, 1, pp. 231-240, (2021); Aksoy S., Değişen Teknolojiler ve Endüstri 4.0: Endüstri 4.0’ı Anlamaya Dair Bir Giriş.

Currently, there is a lack of consensus about digital health research priorities in palliative care and a lack of theories about how these technologies might improve care outcomes. Therefore, it is important for health care leaders to identify innovations to ensure that an increasingly frail population has appropriate access to palliative care services. Consequently, it is important to articulate research priorities as the first step in determining how finite resources should be allocated to a field saturated with rapidly developing innovation. Objective: The aim of this study is to identify research priority areas for digital health in palliative care. Methods: We selected digital health trends, most relevant to palliative care, from a list of emerging trends reported by a leading institute of quantitative futurists. We conducted 2 rounds of the Delphi questionnaire, followed by a consensus meeting and public engagement workshop to establish a final consensus on research priorities for digital technology in palliative care. We used the views of public representatives to gain their perspectives on the agreed priorities. Results: A total of 103 experts (representing 11 countries) participated in the first Delphi round. Of the 103 experts, 55 (53.3%) participated in the second round. The final consensus meetings were attended by 10.7% (11/103) of the experts. We identified 16 priority areas, which involved many applications of technologies, including care for patients and caregivers, self-management and reporting of diseases, education and training, communication, care coordination, and research methodology. We summarized the priority areas into eight topics: big data, mobile devices, telehealth and telemedicine, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, smart home, biotechnology, and digital legacy. Conclusions: The priorities identified in this study represent a wide range of important emerging areas in the fields of digital health, personalized medicine, and data science. Human-centered design and robust governance systems should be considered in future research. It is important that the risks of using these technologies in palliative care are properly addressed to ensure that these tools are used meaningfully, wisely, and safely and do not cause unintentional harm. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

Regional economy is characterized by its integrity, relativity, relative independence, and spatial difference. With the increasing development of science and technology and big data, it has become a normal trend to use artificial intelligence technology to solve current social problems. In this paper, the social problems caused by the imbalance of regional economy are analyzed based on artificial intelligence. Through the application of KNN-SVM algorithm optimization, it is found that AI has relatively little impact on the development of the income level of the population under the age of 25 in each region. Compared with previous studies, the quality is compared with the innovation of this document, which is the development of a conceptual framework approach, an environmental pollution analysis mechanism, and income inequality analysis. The empirical research results show that under the strategic background of improving people’s livelihood, accelerating the reform of ecological civilization and promoting the construction of the health system, the relationship between environmental pollution and population income caused by unbalanced regional economic development can be re-analyzed through the best KNN-SVM algorithm. The implementation of the healthy China strategy has important theoretical and practical significance. © 2022 by the author.","environmental pollution; KNN-SVM algorithm optimization; residents’ income; unbalanced regional economic development","algorithm; artificial intelligence; conceptual framework; environmental quality; human activity; innovation; livelihood; regional development; regional economy; socioeconomic conditions","","","","","","","Mollalo A., Vahedi B., Bhattarai S., Hopkins L.C., Banik S., Vahedi B., Predicting the hotspots of age-adjusted mortality rates of lower respiratory infection across the continental United States: Integration of GIS, spatial statistics and machine learning algorithms, Int.

AI technologies and the datasets that drive them are products of human choices and power arrangements that have real and lasting implications for human and planetary health. Creating new futures for health and care in an AI era will require abolition. Abolition is a mindset and a movement rooted in transformative justice. It is not a homogenous or hierarchical movement, but the work of many hands over generations. In the absence of obvious and accessible resources and clinical practices designed to disrupt and reimagine AI for health and care, nurses must build their own. Numerous experts working with communities disproportionately harmed by historical and current forms of AI and big data have argued that unless the innovation ecosystems are profoundly disrupted and power redistributed within these systems, these technologies will only serve to reinforce and deepen existing forms of injustice. © Jess Dillard-Wright, Jane Hopkins-Walsh, and Brandon Brown 2023 selection and editorial matter, individual chapters, the contributors.","","","","","","","","","Ahuja A.S., The impact of artificial intelligence in medicine on the future role of the physician, PeerJ, 7, (2019); Benjamin R., Race after technology: Abolitionist tools for the new jim code, (2019); Broussard M., Artificial unintelligence: How computers misunderstand the world, (2018); Broussard M., Letting go of technochauvinism, Public Books, (2019); Campbell A.C., Lavallee C.A., A community of practice for social justice: Examining the case of an international scholarship alumni association in Ghana, Journal of Studies in International Education, 24, 4, pp. 409-423, (2020); Cato K.D., McGrow K., Rossetti S.C., Transforming clinical data into wisdom: Artificial intelligence implications for nurse leaders, Nursing Management, 51, 11, pp. 24-30, (2020); Crawford K., Atlas of AI, (2021); Dillard-Wright J., Electronic health record as a panopticon: A disciplinary ap-paratus in nursing practice, Nursing Philosophy, 20, 2, (2019); Eriksson H., Salzmann-Erikson M., The digital generation and nursing robotics: A netnographic study about nursing care robots posted on social media, Nursing Inquiry, 24, 2, (2017); Eubanks V., Automating inequality: How high-tech tools profile, police, and punish the poor, (2017); Fischer M., Terrorizing gender: Transgender visibility and the surveillance practices of the U.S. security state, (2019); Gance-Cleveland B., McDonald C.C., Walker R.K., Use of theory to guide development and application of sensor technologies in Nursing, Nursing Outlook, 68, 6, pp. 698-710, (2020); Hamid S.T., Community defense: Sarah T.

Driven and defined by a culture of innovation, recent technological advances have revolutionized modern laboratory medicine and added significant value and visibility to its role in healthcare and clinical decision-making. Noteworthy innovations in laboratory automation, genomics, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, microfluidics, and electronic tools have changed the face of omics research. The growing application of these technologies, as well as their integration with microtechnology and point-of-care testing, has contributed to improved patient outcomes and narrowing of the clinical-laboratory interface to facilitate a patient-centered approach to healthcare. However, to adequately capitalize on these advancements, new tools such as artificial intelligence and data mining are needed to harness the exciting potential of medical big data derived from these novel techniques. The current review provides an overview of the recent technological advancements in laboratory medicine, with a critical discussion on their clinical utility and future perspectives. The promise and potential for precision and personalized medicine is also discussed and appraised, with specific attention paid to the contingency of its success on advanced information technology capabilities. © 2022 The Author(s).

The current manuscript systematically analyzes existing studies mitigating strategies for disruption management in the healthcare supply chain during COVID-19. Using a systematic approach, we recognized 35 related papers. Artificial intelligence (AI), block chain, big data analytics, and simulation are the most important technologies employed in supply chain management in healthcare. The findings reveal that the published research has concentrated mainly on generating resilience plans for the management of COVID-19 impacts. Furthermore, the vulnerability of healthcare supply chains and the necessity of establishing better resilience methods are emphasized in most of the research. However, the practical application of these emerging tools for managing disturbance and warranting resilience in the supply chain has been examined only rarely. This article provides directions for additional research, which can guide researchers to develop and conduct impressive studies related to the healthcare supply chain for different disasters. © 2023","COVID-19; Healthcare supply chain; Literature review; Pandemics; Supply chain management","SARS-CoV-2 vaccine; artificial intelligence; blockchain; cloud computing; computerized provider order entry; coronavirus disease 2019; disaster response; follow up; fuzzy system; health care delivery; human; internet of things; Nash equilibrium; pandemic; practice guideline; Review; social network; systematic review; technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution; three dimensional printing","","","","","","","Aldrighetti R., Zennaro I., Finco S., Battini D., Healthcare supply chain simulation with disruption considerations: a case study from Northern Italy, Global J Flex Syst Manag, 20, 1, pp. 81-102, (2019); Emmett D., Supply chains in healthcare organizations: lessons learned from recent shortages, Hosp Top, 97, 4, pp. 133-138, (2019); Babatunde S., Oloruntoba R., Agho K., Healthcare commodities for emergea ncies in Africa: review of logistics models, suggested model and research agenda, J Humanit Logist Supply Chain Manag, (2020); Botchie D., Damoah I.S., Tingbani I., From preparedness to coordination: operational excellence in post-disaster supply chain management in Africa, Prod Plann Control, 32, 1, pp. 1-18, (2021); Abu Zwaida T., Elaroudi K., Beauregard Y., The challenges of drug shortages in the Canadian hospital pharmacy supply chain—a systematic literature review, J.

Steven Case, in 2016, predicted a “third wave” of innovation that would leverage big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to transform medicine and finally achieve reduced costs, improved efficiency, and better patient outcomes. Academic medical centers (AMCs) have the infrastructure and resources needed by digital health intrapreneurs and entrepreneurs to innovate, iterate, and optimize technology solutions for the major pain points of modern medicine. With large unique patient data sets, strong research programs, and subject matter experts, AMCs have the ability to assess, optimize, and integrate new digital health tools with feedback at the point of care and research-based clinical validation. As AMCs begin to explore digital health solutions, they must decide between forming internal teams to develop these innovations or collaborating with external companies. Although each has its drawbacks and benefits, AMCs can both benefit from and drive forward the digital health innovations that will result from this journey. This viewpoint will provide an explanation as to why AMCs are ideal incubators for digital health solutions and describe what these organizations will need to be successful in leading this “third wave” of innovation. ©Adeel A Faruki, Richard D Zane, Jennifer L Wiler.","academic health systems; academic hospitals; cost; digital health; disruption; entrepreneur; health technology; innovation; intrapreneur; investment; research programs","","","","","","","","Case S., The Third Wave: An Entrepreneur's Vision of the Future, (2017); Toussaint J., Why Haven healthcare failed, Harvard Business Review, (2021); Fry E., How Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway took on America's health care system—and lost, Fortune, (2021); Densen P., Challenges and opportunities facing medical education, Trans Am Clin Climatol Assoc, 122, pp. 48-58, (2011); Balas EA, Chapman WW., Road map for diffusion of innovation in health care, Health Aff (Millwood), 37, 2, pp. 198-204, (2018); Stein D, Chen C, Ackerly DC., Disruptive innovation in academic medical centers, Acad Med, 90, 5, pp. 594-598, (2015); Cooper P., The Future of the academic medical center: strategies to avoid a margin meltdown, (2012); Naessens JM, Van Such MB, Nesse RE, Dilling JA, Swensen SJ, Thompson KM, Et al., Looking under the streetlight?

AI helps in different ways in medical industries, such as analysing the disease progression rate, effective prediction of treatment method, and proper disease diagnosis. Advantages of artificial intelligence in the food business include enhanced customer accessibility, improved technological innovation, readily accessible client requirements and comments, strategic advantage through unique products, and plenty others. Different AI technologies such as ""Machine Learning (ML),""""Neural Language Processing (NLP),""""Rule-Based Expert Systems (RESs),""""Deep Learning (DL),""and so on are used in healthcare and food industries for big ""medical data""analysis. This study has applied three critical variables to measure the application of AI in enhancing food quality (viz., usage of machine learning models, NLP models, etc.). This study has stated that these models support in enhancing the overall food quality in an effective manner. The present research analyses the importance of these AI technologies in enhancing service quality in healthcare and food industries. A primary survey-based data analysis has been done with 153 individuals taken from healthcare industries. Moreover, statistical analysis has been done in this research with SPSS software. Four independent variables are taken in this research, which are ML, NLP, RES, and DL. The service quality of healthcare has been taken as a dependent variable, and the effect of independent variables on ""enhancing healthcare service""has been analysed. Secondary thematic analysis has been done to justify primary data. The results show that 43.79% of the individuals have supported DL and 56.86% have supported the treatment prediction ability AI. 37.9% of the individuals have also supported AI over traditional medications. Further analysis has shown that independent variables ML, DL, NLP, and RES have a strong positive correlation with improving SQ. These results have been justified by secondary journals, and it is proved that AI technologies enhance the service quality in healthcare and food sectors. © 2022 S. K.

The application of an artificial intelligence system to medical research has the potential to move toward highly advanced e-Health. This analysis aims to explore the main areas of application of big data in healthcare, as well as the restructuring of the technological infrastructure and the integration of traditional data analytical tools and techniques with an elaborate computational technology that is able to enhance and extract useful information for decision-making. We conducted a literature review using the Scopus database over the period 2010–2020. The article selection process involved five steps: the planning and identification of studies, the evaluation of articles, the extraction of results, the summary, and the dissemination of the audit results. We included 93 documents. Our results suggest that effective and patient-centered care cannot disregard the acquisition, management, and analysis of a huge volume and variety of health data. In this way, an immediate and more effective diagnosis could be possible while maximizing healthcare resources. Deriving the benefits associated with digitization and technological innovation, however, requires the restructuring of traditional operational and strategic processes, and the acquisition of new skills. © 2022 by the authors.

Huge volume of information being produced and collected by these IoT devices is also called Big Data, which needs to be managed, processed, and analyzed for the development of the social sector such as health care, education and smart community, and industrial sectors like manufacturing and production. Big Data analytics and processing have contributed to the advancement of society as well as improved the industrial processes. High speed and continuous sensing generate huge volumes of complex data, and processing and analyzing these data in a certain time limit is a big challenge. For a real-time decision-making and monitoring system, data processing and analysis are challenging due to limited computational, communicational, and storage resources. Big Data analytics and processing tools can be applied over these massive data as per the type of application and outcome required. Different types of applications need to be supported by a variety of tools based on different principles and approaches. Big Data is a set of voluminous and heterogeneous information in a coordinate, semi-structured, and unstructured form. Modern innovation in machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and artificial intelligence (AI) fulfills the requirement of Big Data analytics processing for advanced real-time decision-making, monitoring, and controlling systems. Classification and processing of stream of data generated by sensing devices help predict future insights. It identifies information required to control and monitor decisions for an individual, a society, an organization, and an industrial application. In this chapter, we discuss the algorithm, principal tools, and technologies required for Big Data analytics and processing over data gathered by different sensing and Internet of Things devices. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Big data; Deep learning; Machine learning; Sensors; Smart cities; Smart devices","","","","","","","","Yaqoob I., Hashem I.A.T., Gani A., Mokhtar S., Ahmed E., Anuar N.B., Vasilakos A.V., Big data: From beginning to future, International Journal of Information Management, 36, 6, pp. 1231-1247, (2016); Gantz J., Reinsel D., Extracting value from chaos, IDC iView, 1142, pp. 1-12, (2011); Golchha N., Big Data-The information revolution, IJAR, 1, 12, pp. 791-794, (2015); Tsai C.-W., Et al., Big data analytics: A survey, Journal of Big Data, 2, 1, pp. 1-32, (2015); Al Nuaimi E., Et al., Applications of big data to smart cities, Journal of Internet Services and Applications, 6, (2015); Kambatla K., Et al., Trends in big data analytics, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, 74, 7, pp. 2561-2573, (2014); Borkar V., Carey M.J., Li A.C., Inside “big data management”: Ogres, onions, or parfaits?, Proceedings of the 15th international conference on extending database technology, EDBT '12, pp. 3-14, (2012); Gani A., Et al., A survey on indexing techniques for big data: Taxonomy and performance evaluation, Knowledge and Information Systems, 46, 2, pp. 241-284, (2016); Kwon O., Lee N., Shin B., Data quality management, data usage experience and acquisition intention of big data analytics, International Journal of Information Management, 34, 3, pp. 387-394, (2014); Mital R., Coughlin J., Canaday M., Using big data technologies and analytics to predict sensor anomalies, Proceedings of the advanced Maui optical and space surveillance technologies conference, held in Wailea, Maui, Hawaii, September 15-18, 2014, (2015); Oswal S., Koul S., Big data analytic and visualization on mobile devices, Proceedings of national conference on New Horizons in ITNCNHIT, (2013); Candela L., Castelli D., Pagano P., Managing big data through hybrid data infrastructures, ERCIM News, 89, pp. 37-38, (2012); Menon A., Big data@ facebook, Proceedings of the 2012 workshop on management of big data systems, pp. 31-32, (2012); Boellstorff T., Coming of age in second life: An anthropologist explores the virtually human, (2015); Silva T.H., Vaz De Melo P.O.S., Almeida J.M., Loureiro A.A.F., Large-scale study of city dynamics and urban social behavior using participatory sensing, IEEE Wireless Communications, 21, 1, pp. 42-51, (2014); Su T., Zhu C., Lv Z., Liu C., Li X., Multi-dimensional visualization of large-scale marine hydrological environmental data, Advances in Engineering Software, 95, pp. 7-15, (2016); Bashir M.R., Gill A.Q., Towards an iot big data analytics framework: Smart buildings systems, High performance computing and communications; IEEE 14th international conference on smart city, pp. 1325-1332, (2016); Cortes C., Vapnik V., Support-vector networks, Machine Learning, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (1995); Song H., Fink G., Jeschke S., Security and privacy in cyber-physical systems: Foundations and applications, (2017); Pantelis K., Aija L., Understanding the value of (big) data, Big data, 2013 IEEE international conference on IEEE, pp. 38-42, (2013); Chithaluru P., Al-Turjman F., Kumar M., Stephan T., I-AREOR: An energy-balanced clustering protocol for implementing green IoT in smart cities, Sustainable Cities and Society, (2020); Shankar A., Pandiaraja P., Sumathi K., Stephan T., Sharma P., Privacy preserving E-voting cloud system based on ID based encryption, Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications., (2020); Punitha S., Al-Turjman F., Stephan T., An automated breast cancer diagnosis using feature selection and parameter optimization in ANN, Computers and Electrical Engineering, (2021); Yadav S.P., Yadav S., Image fusion using hybrid methods in multimodality medical images, Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing, 58, pp. 669-687, (2020); Yadav S.P., Yadav S., Fusion of medical images in wavelet domain: A hybrid implementation, Computer Modeling in Engineering and Sciences, 122, 1, pp. 303-321, (2020); Dighriri M., Lee G.M., Baker T., Big data environment for smart healthcare applications over 5G mobile network, Applications of big data analytics, (2018); Khine K.L.L., Nyunt T.T.S., Predictive big data analytics using multiple linear regression model, Big data analysis and deep learning applications.

Papers in this column will examine the practical, conceptual, and policy dimensions of the use of AI for health-related purposes from comparative and international perspectives. We invite contributions from around the world in all application areas of AI for health, including health care, health research, drug development, health care system management, as well as public health and public health surveillance. The column aims to provide a forum for reflective and critical scholarship that contributes to the ongoing academic and policy debates about the development, use, governance, and implications of AI in medical and health care settings. To launch the column, we first provide an overview of recent approaches that have been developed to identify and address the effects and potential impacts of science and technology innovations on human societies and the environment. These include ethical, legal, and social implications/aspects (ELSI/A) research, responsible research and innovation (RRI), sustainability transitions research, and the use of international standard-setting instruments for responsible and open science issued by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and other international bodies. In Part Two of this essay, we discuss some of the central challenges that arise with regard to the integration of AI and big data analytics in medical and health care settings. This includes concerns regarding (i) the control, reliability, and trustworthiness of AI systems, (ii) privacy and surveillance, (iii) the impact of AI and automation on health care staff employment and the nature of clinical work, (iv) the effects of AI on health inequalities, justice, and access to medical care, and (v) challenges related to regulation and governance. We end the essay with a call for papers and a set of questions that could be relevant for future studies. © 2021 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Ethical, legal and social implications; Global ethics; Governance of emerging technologies; Health; Responsible research and innovation","Artificial intelligence; Data Analytics; Ethical technology; Public health; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Application area; Artificial intelligence in medicine; Emerging technologies; Ethical implications; Global ethic; Governance of emerging technology; International perspective; Legal implications; Responsible research and innovation; Social implication; Health care","","","","","","","Fisher E., Lessons learned from the Ethical, Legal and Social Implications program (ELSI): planning societal implications research for the National Nanotechnology Program, Technol Soc, 27, 3, pp. 321-328, (2005); Knoppers B.M., Zawati M.N.H., Kirby E.S., Sampling populations of humans across the world: ELSI issues, Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet, 13, pp. 395-413, (2012); Carter S.M., Rogers W., Win K.T., Et al., The ethical, legal and social implications of using artificial intelligence systems in breast cancer care, Breast, 49, pp. 25-32, (2020); Cordeiro J.V., Digital technologies and data science as health enablers: an outline of appealing promises and compelling ethical, legal, and social challenges, Front Med (Lausanne), 8, (2021); Zwart H., Landeweerd L., van Rooij A., Adapt or perish?

It has become a leading cause of substantial mortality and morbidity around the world. The emergence of new variants of virus has posed severe challenges for humanitarian society. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has played a vital role in this pandemic and offered various promising innovations to control its dissemination. The current research study presents a scientometric analysis on the literature of ICT-assisted COVID-19 research. In this paper, ICT has been classified into six major categories; artificial intelligence and medical imaging, mobile technology, ubiquitous computing, big data analytics, social media platforms, and printing technology. It extensively examines the role of these technologies in COVID-19 by applying various empirical approaches such as co-citation analysis, publication and citation behavior analysis, participating nations, and knowledge mapping of scientific literature using visualization tool CiteSpace. Furthermore, it provides a visual approach to identify developing paths, evolution trends, research hotspots, cluster analysis, and potential future directions in medical informatics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence;

While they gather, synthesise, and store experiences related to task, performer, and environmental constraints, their internal mental models of judgement and decision-making individually evolve as they perform in different contexts. However, while a large body of work in psychology and behavioural economics has attempted to capture the way humans make decisions, there is a growing realisation among researchers, evaluators, and educational designers that quality improvement interventions cannot be understood outside of the context in which they occur [Ramaswamy, R., Reed, J., Livesley, N., Boguslavsky, V., Garcia-Elorrio, E., Sax, S., Houleymata D., Kimble L., Parry, G. (2018). Unpacking the black box of improvement. International Journal for Quality in Health Care, 30(suppl_1), 15–19. https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzy009]. Approach: In this futuristic proposal, we put forward our vision of how artificial intelligence technologies can unpack and support the internal collections of cognitive knowledge, context, task goals, and on-field experiences that influence sport officiating development. Findings: In what follows, we define what we mean by artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, briefly highlighting their histories in sport analytics contexts. We outline how education is a promising field for the adoption of artificial intelligence/machine learning technologies and conclude by providing a theoretical case study scenario that describes a potential platform through which perspectives of environment, task and performer expertise might be developed for amateur and elite sport officials. Practical implications: Using advanced AI technologies as the basis through which to examine on-field data provides tremendous potential to theoretically tackle the idiosyncrasies of officiating development in a range of sports as it can close the gap between a descriptive analysis (i.e. understanding the interactions undertaken by officials in the presence of others), and a more prescriptive one (i.e. suggesting the actions such officials should have executed). Research contribution: We put forward that artificial intelligence technologies can offer sport organisations sophisticated, constructively based help with opening the “black box” of learning related to sport officiating development. By using ecological dynamics as the fundamental framework through which to filter the data collected, statistical information and qualitative ecological outcomes can be linked and managed into understandable and stable development content [Liu, A., Mahapatra, R. P., & Mayuri, A. V. R. (2021). Hybrid design for sports data visualization using AI and big data analytics.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder, ahead of conduction disturbances and ventricular arrhythmias. Studies estimate that 7.6 million people aged > 65 years in the European Union had atrial fibrillation in 2016, and this figure is predicted to increase by 89% to 14.4 million by 2060. Recent innovations in cardiac arrhythmia care, such as cardiac device miniaturization and smart devices, might revolutionize the future of patient care. Yet, the level of adoption of these breakthroughs will depend on their acceptability by patients and healthcare professionals, and on the pace of transformation of the French healthcare system (encouraged by “Ma Santé 2022”). In this article, we detail the major trends that could impact patients with heart rhythm disorders and their healthcare professionals by 2030. Eight major trends and their associated effects on patient care and healthcare professionals’ practices were discussed: technical evolution of cardiac devices; digitalization of the healthcare system, and telecardiology; the rise of smart devices; the rise of “big data” and artificial intelligence; patient empowerment; evolution of healthcare; healthcare transformation with “Ma Santé 2022”; and new funding models. These “multidimensional” changes give us room in this study to outline two scenarios for the evolution of care of patients with heart rhythm disorders in the near future. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS","Arrhythmia; Artificial intelligence; French healthcare system; Patient empowerment; Smart medical device","Artificial Intelligence; Atrial Fibrillation; Heart; Humans; Prospective Studies; artificial intelligence; atrial fibrillation; digitalization; health care personnel; health care system; heart arrhythmia; human; miniaturization; patient care; patient empowerment; Review; stakeholder engagement; telecardiology; atrial fibrillation; heart; prospective study","","","","","Abbott Medical; Association de Porteurs de Dispositifs Electriques Cardiaques; Boston Scientific and Medtronic; Marie Stella Vanderplanque","Funding text 1: P.

This paper firstly briefly reviews the development of remote sensing geology and the overall effectiveness of remote sensing geological work in Northwest China; secondly, it systematically summarizes the technical innovation results and new understanding achieved by Xi'an Geological Survey Center through constructing the ""Demonstration System of Remote Sensing Detection and Monitoring of Natural Resources in Northwest Special Landscape Area""; meanwhile, it objectively analyzes the applicability, practicality and potential of remote sensing technology in Northwest China's geological work, and shows the important pioneering role of remote sensing technology in Northwest China's resource and energy exploration, geological environment investigation and monitoring, and resource and environment effect analysis in recent years. By sorting out the new challenges and technical shortcomings of using remote sensing technology to solve typical resource and environmental problems in Northwest China, we propose that ""The 14th Five-Year Plan period"" should focus on four application directions:implementation of key ecological projects in Northwest China and comprehensive improvement of key regions, restoration and improvement of mine geological environment, rapid exploration of strategic mineral resources, and optimization of land space in cold and arid regions. At the same time, we should continuously integrate new and advanced information technologies such as big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, 5G and blockchain to carry out mechanism research and methodological innovation in remote sensing rapid and intelligent identification of natural resource elements, quantitative analysis and simulation prediction of dynamic changes in geological environment, spectral remote sensing earth health examination combined with spectrum and image. The results can provide theoretical basis and technical reference for promoting the integration of production-academia-research-use of remote sensing technology in the geological survey of Northwest China. © 2022 Xi'an Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources.

Several therapeutic strategies for CVDs are available, such as medicine, cardiac assist devices, and heart transplantation. However, they are insufficient for the treatment of severe CVD. To develop novel, innovative treatment approaches for CVDs, it is imperative to understand the underlying pathophysiology and to undertake basic research on this facet. The generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has opened avenues for developing new strategies for disease analysis and drug development. This technology has made it possible to obtain pluripotent stem cells from patients with genetic disorders, model the disease in a dish, and use such cells for future regeneration therapy. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), which is widely used for big data analysis in basic research, has potential in various applications in medicine. New tools such as iPS cells and AI can provide much needed novel insights into CVDs. This review focuses on the recent progress in cardiovascular research using these new technologies. © 2022 Japanese Circulation Society.

In this context, there is a need for environments that emulate real-life spaces in which cutting-edge technologies can be implemented for subsequent deployment in society. Smart Labs or Living Labs are spaces for innovation, research and experimentation that integrate systems, devices and methodologies focused on people and their environments. The technologies studied and developed in such labs can then be deployed in human spaces to provide intelligence, comfort, health and sustainability. Health and wellness, energy and environment, artificial intelligence, big data and digital rights are some of the disciplines being studied. At the same time, the UN 2030 Agenda provides a comprehensive framework to promote human well-being through the Sustainable Development Goals. In this work, an evaluation model of its indicators in smart environments is performed through a mixed review methodology. The objective of this work is the analysis and implementation of the SDGs in Smart Labs through a literature review and a case study of UJAmI, the smart laboratory of the University of Jaén. The results provide quantitative and qualitative data on the present and future of the smart devices implemented in the UJAmI lab, providing a roadmap for future developments. © 2021","","Copyrights; Laboratories; Planning; Cutting edge technology; Data rights; Energy and environment; Health and environment; Health and wellness; Innovation research; Integrate systems; Living lab; Smart labs; Smart livings; environmental assessment; environmental indicator; experimental study; implementation process; innovation; literature review; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; technological development; Sustainable development","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (734355); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; European Commission, EC","Funding text 1: FRANCISCO JURADO MELGUIZO.

Recent advancements in omic sciences and computational biology, combined with the development of Precision Nutrition, have contributed to the convergence of nutrition and medicine, as well as more efficient and affordable healthcare solutions that harness the power of food for prevention and therapy. Innovation in this field is crucial to feed a growing global population sustainably and healthily. This requires significant changes in our food system, spanning agriculture, production, distribution and consumption. As we are facing pressing planetary health challenges, investing in bioactive-based solutions is an opportunity to protect biodiversity and the health of our soils, waters, and the atmosphere, while also creating value for consumers, patients, communities, and stakeholders. Such research and innovation targets include alternative proteins, such as cellular agriculture and plant-derived protein; natural extracts that improve shelf-life as natural preservatives; upcycling of agricultural by-products to reduce food waste; and the development of natural alternatives to synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Translational research and innovation in the field of natural bioactives are currently being developed at two levels, using a systems-oriented approach. First, at the biological level, the interplay between these compounds and the human host and microbiome is being elucidated through omics research, big data and artificial intelligence, to accelerate both discovery and validation. Second, at the ecosystem level, efforts are focused on producing diverse nutrient-rich, flavorful, and resilient, yet high-yield agricultural crops, and educating consumers to make informed choices that benefit both their health and the planet. Adopting a system-oriented perspective helps: unravel the intricate and dynamic relationships between bioactives, nutrition, and sustainability outcomes, harnessing the power of nature to promote human health and wellbeing; foster sustainable agriculture and protect the ecosystem. Interdisciplinary collaboration in this field is needed for a new era of research and development of practical food-based solutions for some of the most pressing challenges humanity and our planet are facing today.

A few trends are already foreseeable such as an increased number of patients, advanced technologies, different health-related business models, increased costs, revised ethics, and regulatory procedures. Moreover, cybersecurity, digital invoices, price transparency, improving patient experience, management of big data, and the need for a revised education are challenges in response to digital transformation. Indeed, forward-looking innovation about exponential technologies and their effect on healthcare is now gaining momentum. Thus, we developed a framework, followed by an online survey, to investigate key areas, analyze and visualize future-oriented developments concerning technologies and innovative business models while attempting to translate visions into a strategy toward healthcare democratization. When forecasting the future of health in a short and long-term perspective, results showed that digital healthcare, data management, electronics, and sensors were the most common predictions, followed by artificial intelligence in clinical diagnostic and in which hospitals and homes would be the places of primary care. Shifting from a reactive to a proactive digital ecosystem, the focus on prevention, quality, and faster care accessibility are the novel value propositions toward democratization and digitalization of patient-centered services. Longevity will translate into increased neurodegenerative, chronic diseases, and mental illnesses, becoming severe issues for a future healthcare setup. Besides, data privacy, big data management, and novel regulatory procedures were considered as potential problems resulting from digital transformation. However, a revised education is needed to address these issues while preparing future health professionals. The “P4 of health”, a novel business model that is outcome-based oriented, awareness and acceptance of technologies to support public health, a different mindset that is proactive and future-oriented, and an interdisciplinary setting to merge clinical and technological advances would be key to a novel healthcare ecosystem. Lastly, based on the developed framework, we aim to conduct regular surveys to capture up-to-date technological trends, sustainable health-related business models, and interdependencies. The engagement of stakeholders through awareness and participation is the key to recognizing and improving healthcare needs and services.

The authors hope that both communities find the book useful in deepening their commitment to working closely together. This book compiles extensive information on the potential for Earth Observation (EO) to contribute to public health practice. Contributors include scientists, policy makers, and managers from both the EO and public health communities. This subsequent compilation of expertise along with contributions from the international community, is primarily intended to help managers interested in developing geospatial applications in the area of research, risk assessment, and early warning systems for public health. We hope that both communities find the book useful in deepening their commitment to working closely together. Infectious and chronic diseases, whether on a global, regional, or local level, are public health concerns that affect individuals but pose escalating threats to the larger population. Because generating evidence-based knowledge about these diseases is key to managing them and reducing their impact, the capacity of EO satellites to quickly and accurately collect extensive data sets on the changing drivers for disease occurrence and spread gives public health a tactical advantage in predicting disease risks. To continue improving this capacity and to expand public health applications of EO technology to meet the information needs for a broader range of health risks including its potential to help combat endemic, epidemic, and pandemic infectious diseases future satellite-based EO derived products need to prioritize emerging public health needs. This would entail ensuring that public health information needs regarding climate, environmental, and human population changes are met. These data would also have multiple applications, with the ultimate goal of informing sustainable development and building human resiliency. As the interactions between humans, farm animals, and fauna intensify due to increased trade in bushmeat and wild species, human encroachment on wild habitats, changes in land use practices, and climate, ecosystem, and socio-economic changes the risk of emerging infectious diseases also increases. The recognition of this has led to the widely adopted One Health approach, which promotes inter-sectoral collaboration to integrate human, animal, and environmental health. Interdisciplinary work and inter-sectoral collaboration are promising ways to facilitate data identification and encourage preparation of relevant EO products that can effectively meet public health challenges. EO experts working together with experts from a variety of sectors can push innovation on how and what data are collected and how they are processed and applied to these complicated challenges. Remote sensing can afford us a unique perspective on the Earth, helping us build our scientific understanding of the planet as a system. When combined with other sources of data like health, socio-economic, and demographic data, EO can be an effective tool in nderstanding, modeling, and forecasting public health threats. In its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations (UN) identifies the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of ensuring good health and well-being for people of all ages by strengthening the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks. Remote sensing can play a well-defined role in working to meet the target objectives of the UN's SDG initiative. Major organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) also point to the potential of collaboration between EO sectors and public health experts. With this in mind, this book addressed three basic questions: How does, or can, the current capacities of EO assist public health activities? What are the challenges for operational use of EO in public health? What opportunities are there to further develop EO to the future benefit of public health? Priority themes for which EO appears promising have been identified in this book: 1. For infectious diseases: major epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19, vector-borne diseases transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks, and water-borne diseases such as pathogenic Vibrio species. 2. For chronic illnesses: impact of air pollutants and extreme heat. 3. For all diseases: indicators of human populations at risk could be developed to target the most vulnerable and areas at greatest risk for new disease emergence. The examples for each of these priority themes in this book show the usefulness and benefit of EO data as a strategic tool for assessing and monitoring public health risks in an effective and continuous way. EO images have been able to help identify disease risk areas in endemic countries or in newly emerging areas because they are able to detect land use practices, land cover, climate information such as land or sea surface temperature, and qualities of human urban, suburban, and rural environments. These examples demonstrate that EO data play an important role in developing risk models, which in turn are used to create program-ready risk communication tools such as risk maps. Models and maps make it possible to generate information on the occurrence, importance, and future likely distribution and spatial spread trends of risk, as well as on risk factors that may explain the presence or emergence of a disease. Ultimately, data and products derived from EO make it possible to identify and locate the risk factors in a given territory that determine if a disease or a vector is present or if there is a current risk, given suitable environmental and climate conditions. Risk maps from EO images allow public health actors to anticipate and prepare for health threats because they can act as an early signal. Perhaps most significantly, because EO and risk maps can detect favorable conditions for a disease to appear, they could help us predict disease emergence and epidemics so that we can make informed decisions on early surveillance targets and intervention actions. Therefore, risk maps can support the planning, preparedness, and response to an epidemic or pandemic infectious disease or to an existing condition (chronic disease or endemic infectious disease). Risk maps can also provide information for surveillance programs, outbreak investigations, emergency management, and prevention and control programs, thus supporting resiliency solutions to health threats. EO has proven its ability to detect risks of disease in the environment and the characterization and location of vulnerable populations (Section 2.5). Vulnerability indicators and environmental hazard maps are combined to produce risk maps so that public health decisions and actions can be targeted to those who need it and in the most efficient way. The implementation of risk maps for risk monitoring on a continuous basis has been demonstrated in this book for applications on air quality and water quality (Section 2.3 and 2.4). These products require significant infrastructure and partnerships for big data management and process automation. The products generated meet important needs for public health access to timely, accurate, and authoritative data and IT infrastructure to support effective evidence-based decision making. To generate products effectively, public health organizations need to collaborate with space agencies and other organizations that provide access to EO missions and data streams. Integrating a variety of data sources (e.g. climate, socio-economic, environment) with these data streams for modeling and health systems to generate reliable and consistent results remains essential. Open data and data-sharing policies1 and promotion of participatory approaches to generate and access geospatial information are important prerequisites, as is the collection of health-related in situ data to produce validated spatial analyses. Spatial and analytical innovative solutions using EO in the domains of epidemiological analyses, risk modeling, surveillance, outbreak investigation, and emergency management have the potential to influence public health reactions and shift the epidemic curve toward prediction and prevention of diseases. EO-based information could support many time scales, such as daily and seasonal monitoring for early warning of diseases by forecasting models. An increased capability of public health to conduct mapping and spatial analysis rapidly for decision making depends on the existence of the right combination of open-access data, methods, open-source software or code, tools, technologies, and infrastructure. Solutions for big data storage and analytics from EO and the generation of analysis-ready data to accelerate the computation of risk models could be facilitated by science and technology innovations such as artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and data cubes. Infrastructures such as high-performance computing systems or cloud environments offer promising solutions that need to be explored. Although some satellites provide products that are ready for analysis and some EO satellite prototypes are designed to provide health data, the collaboration of users and science teams working on EO satellite missions could influence the development of innovative instruments that speak to public health needs. Building skilled human resources is essential for effectively using EO data and deriving geospatial information from them. Expertise in EO image analysis and geomatics is vital for the development of risk maps. Methods to develop these skills are recommended for both communities to better collaborate, share knowledge and best practices, and support training and professional development in academia and government organizations. Finally, the development of a strong Community of Practice (CoP) with EO (remote sensing experts) and health (epidemiologists, modelers) and relevant sectors (entomology, biology, climatology, environmental sciences) is at the foundation of innovative actions. We have recommended several approaches to identifying and addressing global and national needs regarding health issues, including through interdisciplinary cooperation and joint activities, formal cooperative agreements and dialogue between sectors, and participation in current CoP such as the GEOHealth CoP. In using this One Health framework together with EO data to examine real-time health challenges around the world, to support sustainable development, and to build human resiliency, we can make important contributions toward understanding and ultimately improving the health of not only humans but of animals and environmental systems alike. © 2022 CAB International.

This chapter addresses the outbreak of coronavirus and how digital healthcare technologies can help navigate and resolve COVID-19 and future epidemics. As the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-2019) spreads, technological advancements and efforts to control the disease, manage clients safely, and promote teamwork among overburdened health care practitioners designing innovative, efficient vaccines would be critical. This review looks at how various healthcare scientific sectors are assisting in the fight against the pandemic, as well as how innovative implementations are being used to treat or cure illness. An analysis of the technical landscape in the COVID-19 sense enables some tentative reflections about the conditions of technical involvement in fighting this once-in-a-century pandemic. Firstly, unlike previous global health crises, it seems to turn people from monitoring artefacts and epidemiological analysis through information creation topics via self-tracking, information sharing, and digital information flows. Furthermore, even if many of such innovations were not implemented, in a previous medical crisis background, their extensive usage on a world basis raises concern about the extent of mobilising domestic spying techniques on racial equality and also worries about government agencies retaining higher monitoring rates long after the end of the pandemic. Within the recent epidemic framework, advanced technical technologies in data analysis and remote monitoring of the urgent laws that require the immediate termination of human rights and the approval of medical equipment and vaccinations by fast-tracking processes have been implemented. Everyone knows that digital healthcare technologies are progressively being embraced in this field for fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. This chapter produced an overview to explain all the efforts being made towards this pandemic in digital healthcare tech. Healthcare centres throughout the world are transitioning to the new technologies listed below to help ease their workload, either by increasing the speed diagnostics or allowing physicians to monitor patients who have been virtually quarantined. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","3D printing; Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Nanotechnology; Robotic technology; Telemedicine","Diagnosis; Disease control; Diseases; Information analysis; Laws and legislation; Patient monitoring; Digital information; Government agencies; Healthcare technology; Information creation; Information sharing; Regulatory authorities; Scientific sectors; Technological advancement; Health care","","","","","","","Roy S., Bhattacharya K.R., Spread of COVID-19 in India: A mathematical model, J.

With the integrated development of related disciplines, the research of sports biomechanics has been extended to the fields of biology, medicine, mechanics, et al. The advance of intelligent testing, big data and artificial intelligence technologies greatly promotes the experimental measurement technologies and simulation methods of sports biomechanics. The renewal of technology and method has gradually expanded and deepened the research content and direction of this discipline and also offered new challenges. This review summarizes the recent advances and points out the development trends and key issues in sports biomechanics. The muscle constitutive theory and calculation of muscle force are the key points in the theoretical modeling and simulation calculation of sports biomechanics. The new testing methods play important role in the competitive sports. Among them the human key point detection algorithm based on deep learning has made a breakthrough in solving the non-contact measurement of competitive sports. The macroscopic damage mechanism of bone, ligament, cartilage, muscle and other tissues has been clarified, but the prediction of their early damage and the mechanism of cross-scale damage still need to be further studied. Intelligent wearable equipment, artificial intelligence and other new technologies have been applied to the research of sports biomechanics and become the hot topics. This review shows that the current research of sports biomechanics is developing towards intelligence, individualization and quantification, integrating with the related disciplines, and continuously promoting the development of scientific and technological innovation in sports, health, medical and other fields. © 2023 Advances in Mechanics.","competitive sports; sports artificial intelligence; sports biomechanics; sports injury and rehabilitation","Biomechanics; Deep learning; Muscle; Wearable technology; Competitive sports; Injury prevention; Integrated development; Intelligent testing; Keypoints; Performance enhancements; Sport artificial intelligence; Sport biomechanics; Sport injury and rehabilitation; Sports injuries; Sports","","","","","","","Cai X D, Mao L J, Zhang B, Et al., The development of physical capacity of talent-transferring athletes in long term cross-country skiing training — based on sports physiological evaluations, China Sport Science, 41, pp. 3-13, (2021); Cao W J., Research on modeling and intelligent control mechod for prosthesis system with gait adaptive bionic knee, (2019); Chen S L, Zhang L., Efficiency and sensitivity of assessment of muscle fatigue by utilizing sEMG parameters, Journal of Wuhan Institute of Physical Education, 45, pp. 71-77, (2011); Chu Z W., Theoretical calculation and variation analysis of hip, knee and ankle joint strength in different load squats, (2020); Fan H B, Sun Y P, Ji L., Age and gender universality research on different upper limbs strength indicators in physical fitness test based surface electromyography muscular contribution, China Sport Science and Technology, 52, pp. 83-97, (2016); Feng Y, Zhou Z, Wang A Y., Correlation between gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscle function and stress fracture of lower limbs, Proceedings of 13th National Conference on Biomechanics.), (2020); Gao H, Wang C Y, Li Z, Et al., Biomechanical changes of the tibial-femoral joint of the knee joint with fixed and moving axes under different flexion states, Journal of Taiyan University of Technology, 52, pp. 144-150, (2021); Guo F, Zhang R H., Surface electromyography of upper extremity muscles for elite female boxers straight punches, Journal of Shenyang Sport University, 28, pp. 65-68, (2009); Guo J Q, Wang Y B, Tian Q, Ren G X, Hu H Y., Advances in flexible multibody dynamics of human musculoskeletal systems, Advances in Mechanics, 52, pp. 253-310, (2022); Huang L, Cai L, Jun H M, Et al., Guiding significance and clinical value of surface electromyography monitoring in the development of rehabilitation strategies for children with encephalitis sequelae, Chinese Journal of Eugenics and Genetics, 29, pp. 398-401, (2021); Huo B, Jiang L, Sun Q, Et al., Challenges posed by winter sports to the fundamental research on biomechanics and applied technologies, Journal of Beijing Sport University, 45, pp. 45-55, (2022); 39, pp. 6-11; Jin S K., Research on fall detection based on wearable sensor, (2021); Li H.

The current strategy to support cancer survivors with impaired QoL is suboptimal, leading to unmet patient needs. ASCAPE aims to provide personalized- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictions for QoL issues in breast- and prostate cancer patients as well as to suggest potential interventions to their physicians to offer a more modern and holistic approach on cancer rehabilitation. Methods and analyses An AI-based platform aiming to predict QoL issues and suggest appropriate interventions to clinicians will be built based on patient data gathered through medical records, questionnaires, apps, and wearables. This platform will be prospectively evaluated through a longitudinal study where breast and prostate cancer survivors from four different study sites across the Europe will be enrolled. The evaluation of the AI-based follow-up strategy through the ASCAPE platform will be based on patients’ experience, engagement, and potential improvement in QoL during the study as well as on clinicians’ view on how ASCAPE platform impacts their clinical practice and doctor-patient relationship, and their experience in using the platform. Ethics and dissemination ASCAPE is the first research project that will prospectively investigate an AI-based approach for an individualized follow-up strategy for patients with breast- or prostate cancer focusing on patients’ QoL issues. ASCAPE represents a paradigm shift both in terms of a more individualized approach for follow-up based on QoL issues, which is an unmet need for cancer survivors, and in terms of how to use Big Data in cancer care through democratizing the knowledge and the access to AI and Big Data related innovations.

Farming processes have already started becoming more efficient due to the development of digital technologies, including big data, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and virtual and augmented reality. Farmers can make the most of the resources at their disposal thanks to this data-driven approach, allowing them to effectively cultivate and sustain crops on arable land. The European Union (EU) aims to make food systems fair, healthy, and environmentally sustainable through the Green Deal and its farm-to-fork, soil, and biodiversity strategies, zero pollution action plan, and upcoming sustainable use of pesticides regulation. Many of the historical synthetic pesticides are not currently registered in the EU market. In addition, the continuous use of a limited number of active ingredients with the same mode of action scales up pests/pathogens/weed resistance potential. Increasing plant protection challenges as well as having fewer chemical pesticides to apply require innovation and smart solutions for crop production. Biopesticides tend to pose fewer risks to human health and the environment, their efficacy depends on various factors that cannot be controlled through traditional application strategies. This paper aims to disclose the contribution of robotic systems in Agriculture 5.0 ecosystems, highlighting both the challenges and limitations of this technology. Specifically, this work documents current threats to agriculture (climate change, invasive pests, diseases, and costs) and how robotics and AI can act as countermeasures to deal with such threats. Finally, specific case studies and the application of intelligent robotic systems to them are analyzed, and the architecture for our intelligent decision system is proposed. © 2023 by the authors.","Agriculture 5.0; AI-based systems; crop protection; green deal; pesticides; smart farming and harvesting; Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","","","","","","","","Ahmad L., Nabi F., Agriculture 5.0: Artificial Intelligence, IoT and Machine Learning, (2021); Ragazou K., Garefalakis A., Zafeiriou E., Passas I., Agriculture 5.0: A new strategic management mode for a cut cost and an energy efficient agriculture sector, Energies, 15, (2022); Chlingaryan A., Sukkarieh S., Whelan B., Machine learning approaches for crop yield prediction and nitrogen status estimation in precision agriculture: A review, Comput.

In response to these challenges, the agri-food industry has increased its efforts to shift to using more digital tools and other advanced technologies. The transition toward digital has been part of the fourth industrial revolution (called Industry 4.0) innovations that have and are reshaping most industries. This literature review discusses the potential of implementing digital technologies in the agri-food industry, focusing heavily on the role of the COVID-19 pandemic in fostering the adoption of greater digitalization of food supply chains. Examples of the use of these digital innovations for various food applications, and the barriers and challenges will be highlighted. The trend toward digital solutions has gained momentum since the advent of Industry 4.0 and implementations of these solutions have been accelerated by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Important digital technology enablers that have high potential for mitigating the negative effects of both the current global health pandemic and the environmental crisis on food systems include artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things, blockchain, smart sensors, robotics, digital twins, and virtual and augmented reality. However, much remains to be done to fully harness the power of Industry 4.0 technologies and achieve widespread implementation of digitalization in the agriculture and food industries.

This is especially true for the clinical drug application of ""toxic"" Chinese medicines which are generally acknowledged as being a fairly complicated and hazard-prone area. These distinguishing features of ""toxic"" Chinese medicines noted above have limited the safe and rational clinical drug application of traditional Chinese medicine. However, previous research approaches have been subject to many limitations such as insufficient integration of basic research with clinical research, the lack of leadership and guidance for the system view and overall view. These trends of current academic studies show that there are plenty of serious difficulties in transforming the research data into effective evidence, to support the present demand for the rational clinical drug application for ""toxic"" Chinese medicines. In the wake of the inclusion of data as one of the elements in the scope of market-oriented reform, the scientific and technological innovation in the area of big data has occasioned the birth of data science. This will generate new opportunities for the development of the traditional Chinese medicine industry. Our team is in the early stages of developing a methodological system for traditional Chinese medicine evidence-based research which is based on the ""four syndromes"", with characteristics of ""syndrome production-syndrome differentiation-syndrome and application-syndrome verification"". This paper is guided by traditional Chinese medicine theory, drawing on the experience from the concept of evidence-based medicine, and introducing multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary technologies, such as digital twins, and artificial intelligence. Based on these parameters, our team further proposes the research concept of evidence-based Chinese medicine toxicology, and plans to build up one new mode of data-intelligence fusion research on clinical ""toxic"" Chinese medicines. To be specific, multi-disciplinary research methods will be applied, such as conventional toxicology, translational toxicology, toxicological genomics and clinical medicine. The research data of ""toxic"" Chinese medicines will subsequently be analyzed, which could include studies on clinical characteristics, toxic substance basis, toxicokinetics, toxic molecular mechanisms and toxicity-effect conversion regulation. Further, the integrative transformation between data and evidence will be carried out with the help of artificial intelligence, a diseasesyndrome digital twin modeling system and other evidence-based toxicological technologies. Thus, the evaluation and prediction method using multiple and integrated evidence for ""toxic"" Chinese medicines will be set up, and then, the research method and technical path of evidence-based Chinese medicine toxicology will be refined, by being built around the core of data-intelligence fusion. In conclusion, this article designates data as the foundation and intelligence as the navigation, to provide new ideas and a reference base for the safety research into Chinese medicine. © 2022, Science Press.

Increasing resource efficiency, safety, and economic efficiency are some of the main goals of Industry 5.0. Herein, wearable Internet of Things devices is parallel to humans to optimize human tasks and meet a new Industry’s requirements. Integrating artificial intelligence algorithms and IoT into wearable technologies and the progress of sensors has created significant innovations in many fields, such as manufacturing, health, sports, etc. However, wearable technologies have faced challenges and difficulties such as security, privacy, accuracy, latency, and connectivity. More specifically, the increasingly massive and complex data volume has dramatically influenced the improvement of the limits. However, these challenges have created a new solution: the federated Learning algorithm. In recent years, federated learning has been implemented with deep learning and AI to enhance powerful computing with big data, stable accuracy, and ensure the security of edge devices. In this chapter, the first objective is to survey the applications of wearable Internet of Things devices in industrial sectors, particularly in manufacturing. Second, the challenges of wearable Internet of Things devices are discussed. Finally, this chapter provides case studies applying machine learning, deep learning, and federated learning in fall and fatigue classification.

A wi de range of principles and fascinating examples are explored in this chapter, including theoretical, methodological, conceptual, and empirical aspects of the subject. This research study is initiated with a description on how IoT and big data are being used to analyze a massive image database created daily from diverse sources using big data, machine learning, and other kinds of artificial intelligence to produce structured data for remote diagnosis. Health care providers may rely on the heterogeneous IoT platform to manage their data reliably, thanks to dedicated computing equipment. It is critical to healthcare service reliability that varied data streams are effectively managed owing to variations and errors. To make sense of the gathered data, a Chi-square-based term feature extraction method was employed. Outliers in sensor data are filtered out and unwanted features are removed with the use of density-based spatial clustering (DBSCAN) and random forest (RF)backward feature elimination (BFE) as RF-BFE. The pre-trained model of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to make predictions based on these features. Finally, experiments are run to determine the effectiveness of the suggested model based on a number of different criteria. © 2022 IEEE.","Big Data; Convolutional Neural Network; Internet of Things; Medical Data; Outliers; Structured Data","Big data; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Diagnosis; Health care; Machine learning; Statistics; Big-data machines; Convolutional neural network; Healthcare systems; Healthcare technology; Image database; Medical data; Outlier; Random forests; Research studies; Structured data; Internet of things","","","","","","","Chen Z., Chen S., Feng X., A design of distributed storage and processing system for internet of vehicles, 2016 8th international conference on wireless communications & signal processing(WCSP), (2016); Mavromoustakis C.X., Mastorakis G., Batalla J.M., Internet of things (IoT) in 5Gmobile technologies, 8, (2016); Idris N., Minimizing the Congestion Index and Mode Share of Traffic Congestion in Urban Area, Journal of Enterprise and Business Intelligence, pp. 24-32, (2022); Asim M., Pasha H.F., Measuring Mult idimency Poverty Method, Journal of Enterprise and Business Intelligence, pp. 33-43, (2022); Eswaran S., Rajakannu M., Multiservice Load Balancing with Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization in Cloud-Based Multimedia Storage System with QoS Provision, Mobile Networks and Applications, 22, 4, pp. 760-770, (2017); Eswaran S., Rani V.D.D., Ramakrishnan J., Selvakumar S., An enhanced network intrusion detection system for malicious crawler detection and security event correlations in ubiquitous banking infrastructure, International Journal of Pervasive Computing and Communications, 18, 1, pp. 59-78, (2021); Rashid M., Goyal V., Parah S.A., Singh H., Drug prediction in healthcare using big data and machine learning, Hidden Link prediction in stochastic social networks, (2019); Lee I., Lee K., The internet of things (IoT): Applications, investments, andchallenges for enterprises, Business Horizons, 58, 4, (2015); Boyes H., Hallaq B., Cunningham J., Watson T., The industrial internet of things (IIoT): An analysis framework, Computers in Industry, 101, (2018); Singh P., Rashid E., Smart home automation deployment on third party cloud using internet of things, Journal of Bioinformatics and Intelligent Control, 4, 1, (2015); Ma X., Wang Z., Zhou S., Wen H., Zhang Y., Intelligent healthcare systems assisted by data analytics and mobile computing, Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing, 2018, (2018); de Filho I.M.B., Aquino G., Malaquias R.S., Girao G., Melo S.R.M., An IoT-based healthcare platform for patients in ICU beds during the COVID-19 outbreak, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 27262-27277, (2021); Dang L.M., Piran Md.J., Han D., Min K., Moon H., A survey on internet of things and cloud computing for healthcare, Electronics, 8, 7, (2019); Uslu B.C., Okay E., Dursun E., Analysis of factors affecting IoT-based smart hospital design, Journal of Cloud Computing, 9, 1, (2020); Greco L., Percannella G., Ritrovato P., Tortorella F., Vento M., Trends in IoT based solutions for health care: moving AI to the edge, Pattern Recognition Letters, 135, pp. 346-353, (2020)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2022 International Conference on Edge Computing and Applications, ICECAA 2022","13 October 2022 through 15 October 2022","Tamilnadu","184201","","978-166548232-5","","","English","Int.

The global exchange of records in the health sector through electronic media is facilitated by cloud computing. In healthcare, this technology increases safety and creates innovation. Communication with the health matrix throughout the world makes feasible by the application of this technology. Cloud computing has been utilised in health care for many years and has evolved in conjunction with developments in business. This technology establishes standard accessible hardware for diverse healthcare applications via a network connection. Cloud computing and processing ensure safe communication, and the cloud servers secure all essential data. Doctors can counsel their individuals on their health and broadcast their patient's daily health regimes, typically keeping their minds and bodies healthy. Psychologists and psychiatrists can use videoconferencing that makes patients comfortable with their patients. This paper discusses cloud computing and its need for healthcare. Major key advantages, barriers, and challenges of Cloud computing for the healthcare industry are identified. Finally, it discusses the significant applications of cloud computing for healthcare. Today more and more healthcare suppliers are providing Internet of Things (IoT) enabled gadgets to patients, and patient data are instantly communicated to their doctors by linking such devices to the cloud system of hospitals. As a result, cloud computing, in conjunction with fast-expanding technologies such as Big Data analytics, artificial intelligence, and the internet of medical things, improves efficiencies and expands the number of ways to streamline healthcare delivery. It improves resource availability, improves interoperability, and reduces costs. © 2022","Applications; Cloud computing; Data; Healthcare; Information","","","","","","","","Liao W.H., Qiu W.L., Applying analytic hierarchy process to assess healthcare-oriented cloud computing service systems, Springer Plus, 5, 1, pp. 1-9, (2016);

The benefit of using IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence for community and population health is better health outcomes for the population and communities. The new generation of machine-learning algorithms can use large standardized data sets generated in healthcare to improve the effectiveness of public health interventions. A lot of these data come from sensors, devices, electronic health records (EHR), data generated by public health nurses, mobile data, social media, and the internet.

Yet after a year the worldwide situation is nowhere showing relief in the number of infection cases. Almost the whole world is in the sway of this virus, currently there are about 122milion confirmed cases out of which 69 million people recovered and 2.69 million over the globe have lost their life to this infectious disease. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) of India reported around 11 million cases and 11000 people lost their lives in India. This is a significant disaster to be mentioned in the modern history of mankind. Many comparisons have been drawn to study the relationship with other pandemics and impact of the virus for planning disaster risk and mitigation plans. Due to a lot of uncertainty about the attributes of COVID-19 strains, its incubation period, its transmission, and its feasible treatment, it lays in peril the most advanced medical emergency management system of advanced countries battled to get a grip on the problem. It began when China first reported cases of pneumonia of an unknown origin in Wuhan city, Hubei province. COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread across China, Asia through Thailand, Japan, and Korea in January 2019, it was reported in Europe by February 2019, involving countries like Italy, Spain, and European countries. The virus reached the United Kingdom and the United States, New York City by April 2019 and became the epicentre of the pandemic. The pandemics in modern eras are different from the historical eras. The technological advancement in the field of mass media, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and Big Data, smartphones, and innovations in such areas as robotics and drone technology provides immense amounts of information and generates data on a daily basis to work on the preparedness for disaster management. The objective for the work is to model a trend analysis based on the data available for all countries cities and establish a correlation between the emergence of infection cases with the change in physical properties of climate like temperature, humidity, duration of luminous days, altitude along with density of population to prepare a prospective analysis seasonal variation map for India based on similar conditions using GIS environment for risk assessment and capacity building. © 2023 DMICS.","Capacity building; COVID19; GIS; Risk assessment","","","","","","","","Acuto M., Covid-19: Lessons for an urban(izing) world, One Earth, 2, 4, pp. 317-319, (2020); Ahmadi A., Fadai Y., Shirani M., Rahmani F., Modelling and forecasting trend of covid-19 epidemic in iran until may 13, 2020, Medical Journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran (MJIRI), 34, 1, pp. 183-195, (2020); Ahmadi M., Sharifi A., Dorosti S., Ghoushchi S.J., Ghanbari N., Investigation of effective climatology parameters on covid-19 outbreak in iran. sci, Total Environ, 729, (2020); Allcott H., Boxell L., Conway J., Gentzkow M., Thaler M., Yang D.Y., Polarizationand Public Health: Partisan Differences in Social Distancing during the Coronavirus Pandemic, (2020); Arab-Mazar Z., Sah R., Rabaan A.A., Dhama K., Rodriguez-Morales A.J., Mapping the Incidence of the COVID-19 Hotspot in Iran-Implications for Travellers, (2020); Barr J., Tassier T., Are Crowded Cities the Reason for the COVID-19 Pandemic?

Standards enable interoperability between clinical information systems, healthcare information exchange between institutions, and clinical decision support in a complex health information technology ecosystem. There are several gaps in standards in ophthalmology, including relatively low adoption of imaging standards, lack of use cases for integrating apps providing artificial intelligence -based decision support, lack of common data models to harmonize big data repositories, and no standards regarding interfaces and algorithmic outputs.SummaryThese gaps in standards represent opportunities for future work to develop improved data flow between various elements of the digital health ecosystem. This will enable more widespread adoption and integration of artificial intelligence-based tools into clinical practice. Engagement and support from the ophthalmology community for standards development will be important for advancing this work. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, in recent years, it has been confronted with fundamental questions concerning its future. This report is the follow-up to the one published in 2018 by the National Academies of Medicine and Pharmacy and unfortunately only confirms a strong deterioration at all levels. The public authorities do not assume their role of regulator, thus allowing the excessive financialization of Medical Biology to grow considerably and lead to disproportionate groupings of Medical Biology Laboratories (MBL), destructive and sources of health risks. The result is that the Medical Biology Laboratories in towns, which are already known to be poorly distributed, are gradually becoming simple sampling sites, with patients finding themselves alone, often anxious, with their results sent to them by Internet without interpretation. Moreover, although progress in the field of Medical Biology is incredible and should constitute a major pole of attraction for young people, the disaffection of the discipline is total and worrying. Finally, innovation, in the context of current technological progress: connected devices, artificial intelligence and big data, represents a major challenge for the future. Here again, little or nothing is being done, even though the challenges are immense. After these alarming observations, the report will end with a series of recommendations aimed at optimizing the entry of MBL into a new era. © 2022 John Libbey Eurotext.

However, there is a need for standardized frameworks or platforms accommodating and interconnecting multiple of these systems while ensuring secure, relevant, fair, trust-based data sharing and use. The H2020 project GATEKEEPER aims to implement and test an open-source, European, standard-based, interoperable, and secure framework serving broad populations of aging citizens with heterogeneous health needs. Objective: We aim to describe the rationale for the selection of an optimal group of settings for the multinational large-scale piloting of the GATEKEEPER platform. Methods: The selection of implementation sites and reference use cases (RUCs) was based on the adoption of a double stratification pyramid reflecting the overall health of target populations and the intensity of proposed interventions; the identification of a principles guiding implementation site selection; and the elaboration of guidelines for RUC selection, ensuring clinical relevance and scientific excellence while covering the whole spectrum of citizen complexities and intervention intensities. Results: Seven European countries were selected, covering Europe’s geographical and socioeconomic heterogeneity: Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. These were complemented by the following 3 Asian pilots: Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Implementation sites consisted of local ecosystems, including health care organizations and partners from industry, civil society, academia, and government, prioritizing the highly rated European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Aging reference sites. RUCs covered the whole spectrum of chronic diseases, citizen complexities, and intervention intensities while privileging clinical relevance and scientific rigor. These included lifestyle-related early detection and interventions, using artificial intelligence–based digital coaches to promote healthy lifestyle and delay the onset or worsening of chronic diseases in healthy citizens; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure decompensations management, proposing integrated care management based on advanced wearable monitoring and machine learning (ML) to predict decompensations; management of glycemic status in diabetes mellitus, based on beat to beat monitoring and short-term ML-based prediction of glycemic dynamics; treatment decision support systems for Parkinson disease, continuously monitoring motor and nonmotor complications to trigger enhanced treatment strategies; primary and secondary stroke prevention, using a coaching app and educational simulations with virtual and augmented reality; management of multimorbid older patients or patients with cancer, exploring novel chronic care models based on digital coaching, and advanced monitoring and ML; high blood pressure management, with ML-based predictions based on different intensities of monitoring through self-managed apps; and COVID-19 management, with integrated management tools limiting physical contact among actors. Conclusions: This paper provides a methodology for selecting adequate settings for the large-scale piloting of eHealth frameworks and exemplifies with the decisions taken in GATEKEEPER the current views of the WHO and European Commission while moving forward toward a European Data Space. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

There has been significant progress in healthcare. However, the lack of emotive recognition coupled with a dearth of personalized and pervasive health applications and emotive smart devices calls for the integration of intelligent sensors health systems through emerging technologies. Although there has been significant progress in smart and connected health care, more research innovation, dissemination and technologies are needed to unbundle new opportunities and move towards healthcare 5.0. Healthcare is at the dawn of a paradigm change to reach the new era of smart disease control and detection, virtual care, smart health management, smart monitoring, and decision-making. Therefore, this study discusses the roles and capacities of sensors, their capabilities and other emerging technologies such as nanotechnology, 5 G technologies, drone technology, blockchain, robotics, big data, internet of things, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. Healthcare 5.0 provides healthcare services including patient remote monitoring, tracking and virtual clinics, emotive telemedicine, ambient assisted living, smart self-management, wellness monitoring and control, smart treatment reminders, compliance and adherence, and personalized and connected health care. However, building resilience and robust healthcare 5.0 is not immune to challenges. Organizational challenges, technological and infrastructural barriers, lack of legal and regulatory frameworks and e-health policies, individual perceptions, misalignment with hospitals’ strategy, lack of funding, religious and cultural barriers are identified as potential barriers to the successful implementation of healthcare 5.0. Therefore, there is a need for building resilient technology-driven healthcare systems. To achieve this, there is a need for expanding technological infrastructure, provision of budgetary support based on sustainable business models, develop appropriate legal and e-health policies, standardization and synchronization of protocols, improving stakeholders’ engagement and involvement and establishment of private and public partnerships and investments. © 2021","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Emerging technologies; Healthcare 5.0; Sensors; Smart devices; Virtual care","","","","","","","","Muhammad G., Alshehri F., Karray F., Saddik A.E., Alsulaiman M., Falk T.H., A comprehensive survey on multimodal medical signals fusion for smart healthcare systems, Inf Fusion, 76, pp. 355-375, (2021); Mbunge E., Integrating emerging technologies into COVID-19 contact tracing: opportunities, challenges and pitfalls, Diabetes Metab Syndr, 14, 6, pp. 1631-1636, (2020); Chanchaichujit J., Tan A., Meng F., Eaimkhong S., An Introduction to Healthcare 4.0.

This study aimed to determine views on and expectations of “systems medicine” from the perspective of citizens and patients in six focus group interviews, all transcribed verbatim and content analyzed. A future vision of the use of systems medicine in healthcare served as a stimulus for the discussion. The results show that although certain aspects of systems medicine were seen positive (e.g., use of smart technology, dig-italization, and networking in healthcare), the perceived risks dominated. The high degree of tech-nification was perceived as emotionally burdensome (e.g., reduction of people to their data, loss of control, dehumanization). The risk-benefit balance for the use of risk-prediction models for disease events and trajectories was rated as rather negative. There were normative and ethical concerns about unwanted data use, discrimination, and restriction of fundamental rights. These concerns and needs of citizens and patients must be addressed in policy frameworks and health policy implementation strategies to reduce negative emotions and attitudes toward systems medicine and to take advantage of its opportunities. © 2021 by the authors.

Looking to the future, this trend will contribute to further digitalization and the merging of individual digital products, including medicinal products and medical devices, into a digital ecosystem. This will be supported by ever-shorter development cycles and technological progress. Digitization will not only strengthen patient sovereignty, but also enable more patient-centered medicine; artificial intelligence will improve and accelerate diagnoses and will contribute to a better understanding of disease patterns and underlying mechanisms or causes. In order to continue to enable innovations in the future, to focus on emerging trends, and, above all, to further improve patient safety, the BfArM is contributing in many places to transforming the opportunities associated with digitalization into possibilities – without losing sight of the risks. The following is an overview of how, for example, the expansion of the Research Data Center, activities addressing interoperability, research projects using artificial intelligence, (inter-)national cooperation, the utilization and inclusion of “Real World Data” in our benefit/risk assessments, and the evaluation of digital health and digital care applications among other activities of the BfArM contribute to “digital readiness” in Germany and Europe. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; BfArM; Big data; DiPA; Interoperability; Research data center","Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Delivery of Health Care; Ecosystem; Germany; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; artificial intelligence; ecosystem; Germany; health care delivery; human; pandemic","","","","","","","Digital Health, (2020); White Paper: Wie Digitale Gesundheitsanwendungen für Patienten Mehrwert Schaffen können., (2021); Medizininformatikinitiative, Homepage., (2021); GAIA - X., (2021); Big Data Steering Group Report 2020, (2021); European Health Data Space, (2021); (2021); ITU (2021) the ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H; Bfarm (2021) SNOMED CT; Weber S., Heitmann K.U., Interoperabilität im Gesundheitswesen: auch für Digitale Gesundheitsanwendungen (DiGA) verordnet, (2021); DVPMG., (2021); Bfarm, (2021); Innovationsbüro Des Bfarm., (2021); DVG Start-Up Roadshow, (2021)","W.

Sierra Leone’s government launched its first digital health strategy in 2018. In 2019, a broader national innovation and digital strategy was launched. The health pillar direction will use big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve health care in general and maternal and child health in particular. Understanding the number, distribution, and interoperability of digital health solutions is crucial for successful implementation strategies. Objective: This paper presents the state of digital health solutions in Sierra Leone and how these solutions currently interoperate. This study further presents opportunities for big data and AI applications. Methods: All the district health management teams, all digital health implementing organizations, and a stratified sample of 72 (out of 1284) health facilities were purposefully selected from all health districts and surveyed. Results: The National Health Management Information System’s (NHMIS’s) aggregate reporting solution populated by health facility forms HF1 to HF9 was, by far, the most used tool. A health facility–based weekly aggregate electronic integrated disease surveillance and response solution was also widely used. Half of the health facilities had more than 2 digital health solutions in use. The different digital health software solutions do not share data among one another, though aggregate reporting data were sent as necessary. None of the respondents use any of the health care registries for patient, provider, health facility, or terminology identification. Conclusions: Many digital health solutions are currently used at health facilities in Sierra Leone. The government can leverage current investment in HIS from surveillance and reporting for using big data and AI for care. The vision of using big data for health care is achievable if stakeholders prioritize individualized and longitudinal patient data exchange using agreed use cases from national strategies. This study has shown evidence of distribution, types, and scale of digital health solutions in health facilities and opportunities for leveraging big data to fill critical gaps necessary to achieve the national digital health vision. © Emeka Chukwu, Lalit Garg, Edward Foday, Abdul Konomanyi, Royston Wright, Francis Smart.

Drug repurposing has also proved important to develop interventions against the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a new approach for drug repurposing involving two-stage prediction and machine learning. First, diseases are clustered by gene expression on the premise that similar patterns of altered gene expression imply critical pathways shared in different disease conditions. Next, drug efficacy is assessed by the reversibility of abnormal gene expression, and results are clustered to identify repurposing targets. To cluster similar diseases, gene expression data from 262 cases of 31 diseases and 268 controls were analyzed by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction followed by k-means to optimize the number of clusters. For evaluation, we examined disease-specific gene expression data for inclusion, body myositis, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis (DM), and used LINCS L1000 characteristic direction signatures search engine (L1000CDS2) to obtain lists of small-molecule compounds that reversed the expression patterns of these specifically altered genes as candidates for drug repurposing. Finally, the functions of affected genes were analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to examine consistency with expected drug efficacy. Consequently, we found disease-specific gene expression, and importantly, identified 20 drugs such as BMS-387032, phorbol-12-myristate-13-Acetate, mitoxantrone, alvocidib, and vorinostat as candidates for repurposing. These were previously noted to be effective against two of the three diseases, and have a high probability of being effective against the other. That is, inclusion body myositis and DM. The two-stage prediction approach to drug repurposing presented here offers innovation to inform future drug discovery and clinical trials in a variety of human diseases. © Yi Cong, et al., 2022.

Material and methods: Since September 2019, 27 European MPEs representing ESTRO, EFOMP and National Societies, with expertise covering all subfields of RT physics, have revised the CC for recent advances in RT. The ESTRO and EFOMP Education Councils, all European National Societies and international stakeholders have been involved in the revision process. Results: A 4-year training period has been proposed, with a total of 240 ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System). Training entrance levels have been defined ensuring the necessary physics and mathematics background. The concept of competency-based education has been reinforced by introducing the CanMEDS role framework. The updated CC includes (ablative) stereotactic-, MR-guided- and adaptive RT, particle therapy, advanced automation, complex quantitative data analysis (big data/artificial intelligence), use of biological images, and personalized treatments. Due to the continuously increasing RT complexity, more emphasis has been given to quality management. Clear requirements for a research project ensure a proper preparation of MPE residents for their central role in science and innovation in RT. Conclusion: This updated, 3rd edition of the CC provides an MPE training framework for safe and effective practice of modern RT, while acknowledging the significant efforts needed in some countries to reach this level. The CC can contribute to further harmonization of MPE training in Europe. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Core curriculum (CC); Education and training; ESTRO-EFOMP; Medical Physics Expert (MPE); Radiotherapy physics","Artificial Intelligence; Curriculum; Europe; Health Physics; Humans; Radiation Oncology; adult; article; artificial intelligence; automation; big data; curriculum; data analysis; education; Europe; female; human; human experiment; male; mathematics; organization; particle therapy; physics; quantitative analysis; radiotherapy; resident; total quality management; artificial intelligence; curriculum; education; health physics; radiation oncology","","","","","ESTRO Educational Council; European National Societies of Medical Physicists; American Association of Physicists in Medicine, AAPM; International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA","The authors gratefully acknowledge:, - Chiara Gasparotto, Viviane Van Egten, Valérie Cremades and Simone De Ioanna of the ESTRO office for their efficient assistance through all the revision process;, - the ESTRO Educational Council, European National Societies of Medical Physicists and international stakeholders (AAPM – American Association of Physicists in Medicine, ACPSEM – Australian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine, AMPI – Association of Medical Physics of India, CAMPEC – Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Education Programs, COMP – Canadian Organization of Medical Physicists, CCPM – Canadian College of Physicists in Medicine, IAEA – International Atomic Energy Agency) for critical revision of the document.","(2013); Eudaldo T., Huizenga H., Lamm I.-L., McKenzie A., Milano F., Schlegel W., Et al., Guidelines for education and training of medical physicists in radiotherapy.

However, most existing data, position statements and guidelines are limited by the lack of availability of large clinical trials to support these recommendations. Furthermore, there are significant challenges regarding proper access to cardio-oncology care and treatment, particularly in marginalized and minority populations. The emergence and evolution of personalized medicine, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning in medicine and in cardio-oncology provides an opportunity for a more targeted, personalized approach to cardiovascular complications of cancer treatment. The proper implementation of these new modalities may facilitate a more equitable approach to adequate and universal access to cardio-oncology care, improve health related outcomes, and enable health care systems to eliminate the digital divide. This article reviews and analyzes the current status on these important issues.

The Internet of Things (IoT) are often heard and successful in business revolution from all sectors. The IoT are widely used in numerous sectors including medical services and have become the rise of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). One of the implementations is the Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. Previously the health records were used in traditional manner such as print-out health record of a patient and stored to an archive room. With the innovation of EHR, patients' health records are digitalized which provides advantages from space efficiency and paperless forms. EHR helps medical service management to provide better healthcare services. With the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data Analysis in EHR, healthcare services provide more accurate and reliable diagnosis.  © 2021 ACM.","Analysis; artificial intelligence; big data; electronic medical records; internet of things","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data handling; Diagnosis; Health care; Information analysis; Internet of things; Analyse; Health records; Healthcare services; Medical services; Paperless; Patient health; Service management; Space efficiencies; Medical computing","","","","","College Excellence Basic Research, (B/112/E3/RA.00/2021); Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi, DIKTI","The authors would like to thank the Directorate General of Higher Education, College Excellence Basic Research grants, Ref.

Additional technological advancements have emerged that are anticipated to further transform haemophilia care. Aim: Review new and emerging haemophilia therapies, including replacement and bypassing products, digital applications, utilisation of big data, and personalised medicine. Methods: Data were obtained from peer-reviewed presentations/publications, and ongoing studies in haemophilia, ultrasonography, and artificial intelligence (AI). Results: Available treatments include new recombinant factors VIII (FVIII) and IX (FIX), extended half-life FVIII/IX products, a new FVIIa product for inhibitor patients, and a FVIIIa-mimetic. Several novel therapeutics are in clinical trials, including FVIIIa mimetics and inhibitors of naturally-occurring anticoagulants. Ongoing gene therapy trials suggest that a single vector infusion using an optimised construct can produce factor activity that reduces bleeding to near zero for years. Today, persons with haemophilia (PwH) approach a lifespan comparable to that of the general population, presenting treatment challenges for age-related co-morbidities. Technological innovations have broadened beyond therapeutics to include large database analyses utilising remote data collection with handheld devices, and to tailor AI applications. Current development efforts include patient-performed ultrasonography, algorithms for scan interpretation, and point-of-care haemostatic testing devices. Conclusions: We have entered a golden age for haemophilia treatment and care with wide-ranging advancements targeting improved quality of life (QoL). Future-focused efforts by clinical and patient communities may provide equitable access and care for people impacted by haemophilia worldwide. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","gene therapy, health equity, haemophilia; mimetics; MSKUS; novel therapies; technology","Artificial Intelligence; Factor IX; Factor VIII; Half-Life; Hemophilia A; Humans; Quality of Life; concizumab; emicizumab; fitusiran; marstacimab; recombinant blood clotting factor 7a; recombinant blood clotting factor 8; recombinant blood clotting factor 9; blood clotting factor 8; blood clotting factor 9; Article; artificial intelligence; Black person; bone metabolism; bone remodeling; cardiovascular disease; Caucasian; disease severity; drug potency; feasibility study; gene therapy; handheld device; hemophilia A; hemophilia B; hemophilic arthropathy; high risk population; Hispanic; human; lifespan; patient care; peer review; point of care musculoskeletal ultrasound; point of care ultrasound; practice guideline; prevalence; scoring system; thrombosis; thrombosis prevention; half life time; hemophilia A; quality of life","","concizumab, 1312299-39-0; emicizumab, 1610943-06-0; fitusiran, 1499251-18-1; marstacimab, 1985638-39-8; recombinant blood clotting factor 7a, 897936-89-9, 944130-77-2, 1360054-92-7, 1228539-24-9, 1600492-21-4, 102786-61-8; recombinant blood clotting factor 8, 1192451-26-5, 1219013-68-9, 1309086-46-1, 1270012-79-7, 1388129-63-2, 1417412-83-9, 1339940-90-7, 2252477-42-0; recombinant blood clotting factor 9, 177403-26-8, 178900-90-8, 1175512-71-6, 1232401-60-3, 1270012-74-2, 1357448-54-4, 181054-95-5, 2055206-13-6; blood clotting factor 8, 9001-27-8; blood clotting factor 9, 9001-28-9; Factor IX, ; Factor VIII, ","","","Catalyst Biosciences; Jordan Swartz BS; National Hemophilia Foundation, NHF; Pfizer; Roche; Novo Nordisk","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Nihal Bakeer MD, for contributing content relating to ultrasonography, along with Angela Jansen PhD, for assistance with the manuscript, and Jordan Swartz BS, for editing and fact checking.; Funding text 2: A recent ATHN initiative in collaboration with the Center for Digital Health Innovation at the University of California, San Francisco focuses on AI and machine learning. This group is training algorithms to evaluate large, anonymised datasets from PwH to determine how markers are associated with defined patient outcomes. AI algorithms will further be trained based on ATHN studies and information from the ATHNdataset used to validate findings. As part of this initiative, funded by a Pfizer Global Medical Grant, ATHN partnered with the National Hemophilia Foundation to develop consensus definitions of poor outcomes for PwH. The ultimate goal is to create a predictive model to identify PwH at risk for poor outcomes to assist providers to design interventions that improve care. 42 ; Funding text 3: Magdalena Lewandowska is an employee of Indiana Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center that serves as a clinical trial site for several investigational therapies discussed in this manuscript.

Healthcare professionals benefit from decision support provided by machine learning algorithms that analyzes a vast collection of medical data. These technologies send the collected data for storage and processing to a cloud-based platform. The main aim is to give patients a better, extra merit, and inexpensive healthcare service, while enhancing the system's overall effectiveness. Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) is an innovative new solution aimed at allowing advanced health systems to track, control, and make accurate decisions without the involvement of physicians or guardians. However, present MCPS face many key problems where one of the most significant problem is maintaining hospital equipment, which has a strong relationship with patient welfare. Edge computing and cloud computing also known as fog computing can be used to improve MCPS protection by enabling the investment at the data centers. This research work concentrates on a survey of artificial intelligence algorithms for healthcare applications and also provides a detailed record of the saturation oxygen (SpO2), respiration rate (RR), heart rate (HR), pulse, and blood pressure (BP). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Artificial intelligence; Healthcare application; Internet of Health Things; Medical Cyber-Physical System","Artificial intelligence; Cloud analytics; Cyber Physical System; Data Analytics; Data handling; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Fog computing; Health care; Internet of things; Learning algorithms; Block-chain; Data analytics; Health care application; Health clouds; Healthcare industry; Internet of health thing; Machine learning approaches; Machine-learning; Medical cyber physical systems; Wireless sensor; Blood pressure","","","","","","","Shakya S., Intelligent and adaptive multi-objective optimization in WANET using bio inspired algorithms, J.

When not implemented in a well-designed manner, an inefficient management platform can have a significant negative impact on patients and the utilization of health care resources. Innovations of recent years in information technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning provide possibilities to design and implement knowledge-based systems and platforms that follow-up, monitor and advise child patients with a chronic disease in an automated manner. In this article we propose the Artificial Intelligence Chronic Management System that combines artificial intelligence, knowledge graph, big data and internet of things in a platform to offer an optimized solution from the perspective of treatment and utilization of resources. The system includes patient and hospital clients, data storage and analytic tools for decision support relying on AI-based services. We illustrate the functionality of the system through different situations frequently occurring in pediatric wards. To assess the feasibility of the AI component, we utilize real life health care data from a hospital in China to develop a classification model for patients with asthma. To provide a more qualitative assessment at the same time, we discuss how the Artificial Intelligence Chronic Management System conforms to the requirements set forth by the standard Chronic Care Model. © 2022 The Authors","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Chronic disease management; Health care application; Machine learning","Big data; Decision support systems; Digital storage; Diseases; Health care; Hospitals; Information management; Knowledge graph; Chronic disease; Chronic disease management; Design and implements; Health care application; Health management; Healthcare resources; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge-based systems; Management platforms; Management systems; Machine learning","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62076218); Zhejiang Province Public Welfare Technology Application Research Project, (LGF18H260004); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFE0126200)","The authors are grateful to the editor and referees for their valuable comments and suggestions for improving the paper.

The biggest challenges we face are related to our current ability to organize and interpret this enormous amount of multidimensional data to extract biological and medical knowledge. For instance, many recent efforts to develop accurate single cell-level resolution maps of human tissues and organs have highlighted the essential need to identify a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the human body that could be widely understood and adopted to accurately assign spatial locations for individual cells and the high content, multidimensional information associated with each of them. This goal is yet to be reached, but progress has been made thanks to many researchers highlighting essential challenges and coming together to prioritize the key desirable characteristics for a human body CCF. Briefly, this CCF would need to work across the several human body scales, be applicable to all (or most) tissues, be able to account for donor differences (e.g., size, shape, sex), and to be useful and acceptable across specialty domains. In direct response to these requirements, I have proposed the “Vasculature as CCF” concept and presented in diverse contexts how based on its natural structural and functional design the vasculature could meet the widely accepted design requirements for a human body CCF. The “Vasculature as CCF” concept is based on the Vasculome's body of knowledge about the unified nature of the vasculature and its essential importance to the survival and function of every cell in the human body. An even more elegant CCF solution has emerged through the constant updating of this knowledge about vasculature with the latest discoveries, and by working to offer practical suggestions about how the “Vasculature for CCF” concept may be applied. Specifically, recent single-cell analysis reports have shown that the endothelial cells (ECs), which form the continuous lining of the entire vasculature, provide their precise positional information within the vasculature, organ, and tissue, information that can be thought of as a molecular EC zip code. ECs molecular signatures have been also shown to be sensitive to changes affecting their local tissue context, as well as to systemic conditions. I am suggesting that ECs may not only be sufficient as a CCF, providing a body-wide positional system for other cells, but also well suited as a functional barometer for various organs' functional tissue units (FTUs), tissue neighborhoods, and body-wide health status. Further development of analytical and computational approaches, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, is needed to pursue and refine this concept, but it is clear that knowledge about the vasculature—effectively the Vasculome—stands ready to provide key support for the next phase of precision biology, and a fundamental basis for precision medicine. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Indeed, as the demand for digital technologies grows, local and regional governments are increasingly committed to improving the lives of their citizens under the principles of privacy, freedom of expression and democracy. The Digital Revolution began between the late 1950s and 1970s and represents the evolution of technology from the mechanical and analog to the digital. The advent of digital technology has also changed how humans communicate today using computers, smartphones and the internet. Further, the digital revolution has made a tremendous wealth of information accessible to virtually everyone. In turn, the book focuses on key challenges for local and regional governments concerning digital technologies during this crisis, e.g. the balance between privacy and security, the digital divide, and accessibility. Privacy is a challenge in the mitigation of COVID-19, as governments rely on digital technologies like contact-tracking apps and big data to help trace peoples patterns and movements. While these methods are controversial and may infringe on rights to privacy, they also appear to be effective measures for rapidly controlling and limiting the spread of the virus. Next, the book discusses the 10 technology trends that can help build a resilient society, as well as their effects on how we do business, how we work, how we produce goods, how we learn, how we seek medical services and how we entertain ourselves. Lastly, the book addresses a range of diversified technologies, e.g. Online Shopping and Robot Deliveries, Digital and Contactless Payments, Remote Work, Distance Learning, Telehealth, Online Entertainment, Supply Chain 4.0, 3D Printing, Robotics and Drones, 5G, and Information and Communications Technology (ICT). © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","5G Communications; Artificial Intelligence; Big Data Analytics; Blockchain Technology; Data Science Policies; Digital and Contactless Payments; Digital Revolution after Pandemic; Distance Learning; E-Commerce; Fourth Industrial Revolution; Internet of Health Things; Machine Learning; Multi Agent Systems; Remote Work; Robotics and Drones; Supply Chain 4.0; Technology Innovation; Telehealth","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","978-303098167-9; 978-303098166-2","","","English","How COVID-19 is Accelerating the Digital Revolut.: Challenges and Opportunities","Book","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160115324"

The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) - including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics - as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19. © 2014 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence (AI); big data; blockchain; COVID-19; digital twin; eHealth; healthcare; Internet of Things (IoT); pandemic; robotics; wearable","Advanced Analytics; Blockchain; Controlled drug delivery; Data Analytics; Diagnosis; Digital twin; Disease control; Engineering education; Knowledge acquisition; Network security; Remote patient monitoring; Robotics; Crowd surveillance; Diagnosis and prognosis; Digital technologies; Internet of thing (IOT); Novel applications; Scientific discovery; Technological innovation; Tracking and tracing; Internet of things","","","","","Bioengineering Lab Group; RISC-19 ICU Board; Smart City Research and Development Project of the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement; Vision Robotics Artificial Intelligence Group; Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, MOLIT; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP, (18NSPS-B149388-01); Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement, KAIA; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2019YFB2102200)","Funding text 1: This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2019YFB2102200; Funding text 2: Manuscript received November 15, 2020; revised March 9, 2021; accepted April 2, 2021.

Big data and artificial intelligence approaches and innovations are currently being utilized to generate large datasets from images, text, sounds, graphs, and signals. New trends in the utilization of deep learning for disease prediction in neurology, oncology, cardiology, and other areas entail converting patient electronic health records, biological system information, physiological signals, biomarkers, and biomedical images to cognitive functions. The current trends in deep learning techniques focus on utilizing neuroimaging analysis to evaluate alterations in local morphological topographies of different brain sub-regions and then predict novel disorder-linked brain patterns. Hence, this chapter presents a detailed overview of different approaches in deep learning for the prediction of major brain diseases such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, brain tumors, depressive disorders, traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disease, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and more.

This chapter analyzes how frontier technologies are supporting the key stakeholders to manage the COVID-19 crises—protect lives, livelihoods, and enhance the quality of risk governance in Asia and the Pacific. This chapter addresses five key lessons emerging from the COVID-19 response: (1) making risk assessment more dynamics, (2) empowering at risk communities, (3) managing a global risk with local action, (4) managing uncertainties, and (5) bridging the gaps in knowledge and understanding in systemic risks. This chapter also outlines three key enablers—frontier technologies, data science, and national innovation systems that help to prepare for the future crises. The nature and scale of risk has changed. In our increasingly complex inter-connected world, managing risk forms the key to preparing for the future. Smart preparedness is the way forward. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, Machine Learning, 5G technologies, drones, automated vehicles, robotics, etc., were used to track, monitor, warn, and support logistics as well as its rapid diagnostic and telemedicine. A wide-range of risk analytics such as impact forecasting and risk informed early warning, indexing and creating risk matrix to target at risk communities which have been developed and put to use in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its intersection with extreme climate events. Digital solutions can help enhanced preparedness to protect at risk communities but also strengthen their resilience. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer 2022.","Cascading risk; COVID-19; Disaster; Health; Technologies","","","","","","","","Leveraging Technology and Innovations for Disaster Risk Reduction and Financing, (2020); 5 Ways 5G Will Transform Healthcare, (2020); Golechha M., COVID-19 containment in Asia’s largest urban slum Dharavi-Mumbai, India: Lessons for policymakers globally, J Urban Health, 97, 6, pp. 796-801, (2020); United Nations Trust Fund for Human Security, (2016); Kaushal J., Mahajan P., Asia’s largest urban slum-Dharavi: A global model for management of COVID-19, Cities, (2021); Mishra P., COVID-19, black swan events and the future of disaster risk management in India, Prog Disaster Sci, (2020); Renn O., Laubichler M., Lucas K., Kroger W., Schanze J., Scholz R.W., Schweizer P.-J., Systemic risks from different perspectives, Risk Anal, (2020); Srivastava S., Flattening the curve COVID-19, ESCAP Expert Opinion and Stories, (2020); Srivastava S., Outpacing COVID-19: Key innovations prompt early warning for early action, ESCAP Expert Opinion and Stories, (2020); Srivastava S., Indexing risk to recover from COVID-19, ESCAP Expert Opinion and Stories, (2020); Srivastava S., STI solutions for a resilient future, ESCAP Expert Opinions and Stories, (2021); Srivastava S., Sarkar-Swaisgood M., Kim S., Dewi M.B.K., Hendy L., 2020 the year when crises converged, ESCAP Expert Opinions and Stories, (2021); Sukhwani V., Shaw R., Operationalizing crowdsourcing through mobile applications for disaster management in India, Prog Disaster Sci, (2020); Operationalizing Asia-Pacific Disaster Resilience Network (APDRN), ESCAP Committee on Disaster Risk Reduction, (2019); Asia-Pacific Disaster Report 2019-the Disaster Riskscape across Asia-Pacific: Pathways for Resilience, (2019); Collaborative actions to harness technologies during Pandemics.

Clinical diagnosis and treatment data is an essential part of healthcare big data, and also the main field of healthcare big data research. With the continuous deepening and extensive development of informatization, hospitals have accumulated a large number of patient-centered clinical diagnosis and treatment data. Deeply mining and analyzing these data through big data technology can provide reference for precise diagnosis and treatment, and standardized prevention and control of diseases. However, conducting relevant research still faces many difficulties and blockages, such as the increased risk of data leakage or abuse, and the difficulty in implementing informed consent. To safely, legally and efficiently utilize clinical diagnosis and treatment data to conduct clinical research and fully tap into the value of these precious medical resources, a tertiary hospital in Beijing has built a research big data platform and developed relevant systems to effectively solve the problems of blockages and difficulties in the application of rich clinical resources to clinical research, and improve the service quality of medical institutions and the conversion rate of scientific research achievements. By introducing the key points and management methods in the implementation of clinical research based on the scientific research big data platform, analyzing and exploring the existing problems and improvement measures, this paper aimed to provide theoretical basis and system reference for high-quality and efficient health and medical big data clinical research, inspire and promote the continuous improvement of medical research management, and promote the development of medical and health science and technology innovation. © 2023 2023 Multipurpose Utilization of Mineral Resources.

Many of the challenges with respect to integrity previously facing competitive sport have been accentuated further during the pandemic. Threats to the integrity of sporting competition include traditional doping, issues of technological fairness, and integration of transgender and intersex athletes in elite sport. The enforced lull in competitive sport provides an unprecedented opportunity for stakeholders in sport to focus on unresolved integrity issues and develop and implement long-lasting solutions. There needs to be a concerted effort to focus on the many technological innovations accelerated by and perfected during COVID-19 that have enabled us to work from home, such as teaching students on-line, applications for medical advice, prescriptions and referrals, and treating patients in hospitals/care homes via video links and use these developments and innovations to enhance sport integrity and anti-doping procedures. Positive sports integrity actions will require a considered application of all such technology, as well as the inclusion of ""omics"" technology, big data, bioinformatics and machine learning/artificial intelligence approaches to modernize sport. Applications include protecting the health of athletes, considered non-discriminative integration of athletes into elite sport, intelligent remote testing to improve the frequency of anti-doping tests, detection windows, and the potential combination with omics technology to improve the tests' sensitivity and specificity in order to protect clean athletes and deter doping practices. © 2021 Edizioni Minerva Medica.

Recent Findings: Novel AI tools are developed using data from electronic health records, imaging, waveforms, clinical notes, and wearables. These tools can accurately predict the perioperative risk for adverse outcomes, the need for blood transfusion, and the risk of difficult intubation. Intraoperatively, AI models can assist with technical skill augmentation, patient monitoring, and management. Postoperatively, AI technology can aid in preventing complications and discharge planning. While further prospective validation is needed, these early applications demonstrate promise in every area of perioperative care. Summary: The practice of anesthesiology is at a precipice fueled by technological innovation. The clinical AI implementation would enable personalized and safer patient care by offering actionable insights from the wealth of perioperative data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Anesthesiology; Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural networks; Automation; Deep learning; Perioperative medicine","adult; anesthesia level; anesthesiologist; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; automation; big data; blood pressure; blood transfusion; deep learning; difficult airway management; difficult intubation; electronic health record; hospital discharge; human; hypotension; imaging; machine learning; natural language processing; perioperative care; perioperative medicine; peroperative care; regional anesthesia; Review","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation, APSF; Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research, FAER; Brigham Research Institute, BRI","VPK reports funding from the Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research (FAER) training grant, Partners Innovation, Brigham Research Institute, Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF), National Institutes for Health (NIH), and Connors Center IGNITE Award.

The 4th industrial revolution has brought numerous advances that are currently integrated in our daily life, including artificial intelligence (A.I.), internet of things (IoT), genetic engineering, 3D-printing and robotics. The health care sector is one of the most impacted by these technologies of the so-called digital era. From the simple advent of medical records to robotic surgery, health care has significantly changed from the XX to XXI century and is constantly changing, incorporating novel technologies. Nephrology is itself an innovative branch of medicine, created as a discipline in the 1960s, with breakthrough inventions, such as the dialysis machine, which made it possible to prolong life of those who suffer from chronic kidney disease; kidney transplant, with point-of-care immunosuppression that favours maintenance of kidney allografts for long years; kidney biopsy, which made it possible to discover the mysteries of glomerulonephritis and nephropathology. Novel technologies, such as A.I., IoT, robotics, stem cells, 3D-printing, mHealth, eHealth and several others are starting to be applied in nephrology, with promising results. It is possible that a great part of these technologies will become routinely available in clinical practice, and the burden of kidney diseases will significantly decrease once prevention, prediction, detection, monitoring and treatment of kidney diseases are more precise, with patients taking part in the process and becoming more and more connected. This book gathers essential information on the technologies that have been applied in nephrology and that can be applied in the future, with real possibilities of improving the care of kidney diseases. At first glance, this work is directed to the entire nephrology community and all the healthcare professionals that deal with kidney diseases. Researchers from different fields, not directly linked to nephrology, may also be interested in the book since many of the topics presented are related to other areas and serve as examples of their uses in medicine, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and big data. Finally, the content provides an important resource to medical students, discussing technologies that will certainly be integrated in their professional practice. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Artificial kidney; ehealth nephrology; Future nephrology; Innovative nephrology; Kidney diseases; Renal technology","","","","","","","","","","","Springer International Publishing","","","","","","","978-303111570-7; 978-303111569-1","","","English","Innovations in Nephrology: Breakthr.

Digital health applications in healthcare include telemedicine, electronic health records, wearable, implantable, injectable and ingestible digital medical devices, health mobile apps as well as the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to medical and public health prognosis and decision-making. As is often the case with technological advancement, progress in digital health raises compelling ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI). This article aims to succinctly map relevant ELSI of the digital health field. The issues of patient autonomy; assessment, value attribution, and validation of health innovation; equity and trustworthiness in healthcare; professional roles and skills and data protection and security are highlighted against the backdrop of the risks of dehumanization of care, the limitations of machine learning-based decision-making and, ultimately, the future contours of human interaction in medicine and public health. The running theme to this article is the underlying tension between the promises of digital health and its many challenges, which is heightened by the contrasting pace of scientific progress and the timed responses provided by law and ethics. Digital applications can prove to be valuable allies for human skills in medicine and public health. Similarly, ethics and the law can be interpreted and perceived as more than obstacles, but also promoters of fairness, inclusiveness, creativity and innovation in health. © Copyright © 2021 Cordeiro.","artificial intelligence; big data; digital health; ethics; law; patient–doctor relationship; telemedicine","algorithm bias; artificial intelligence; clinical assessment; computer security; confidentiality; creativity; data privacy; data protection; data science; decision making; dehumanization; digital technology; doctor patient relationship; health care need; health care quality; health data; health equity; human; information security; informed consent; law; legal aspect; machine learning; medical ethics; patient autonomy; patient participation; professional competence; public health; Review; skill; social aspect; telemedicine","","","","","CHRC, (UIDP/04923/2020); Fundação Ciência e Tecnologia","This present publication was funded by Fundação Ciência e Tecnologia, IP national support through CHRC (UIDP/04923/2020).","Elenko E., Underwood L., Zohar D., Defining digital medicine, Nat Biotechnol, 33, pp. 456-461, (2015); Jain S.H., Powers B.W., Hawkins J.B., Brownstein J.S., The digital phenotype, Nat Biotechnol, 33, pp. 462-463, (2015); Benjamens S., Dhunnoo P., Mesko B., The state of artificial intelligence-based FDA-approved medical devices and algorithms: an online database, NPJ Digit Med, 3, (2020); Murdoch T.B., Detsky A.S., The inevitable application of big data to health care, JAMA, 309, (2013); Topol E.J., A decade of digital medicine innovation, Sci Transl Med, 11, (2019); Emc E.S., Data Science & Big Data Analytics, (2015); Telehealth Implementation Playbook, (2020); Golinelli D., Boetto E., Carullo G., Nuzzolese A.G., Landini M.P., Fantini M.P., Adoption of digital technologies in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic: systematic review of early scientific literature, J Med Internet Res, 22, (2020); Kaplan B., REVISITING HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ETHICAL, LEGAL, and SOCIAL ISSUES and EVALUATION: TELEHEALTH/TELEMEDICINE and COVID-19, Int J Med Inform, 143, (2020); Brody J.E., A pandemic benefit: the expansion of telemedicine, The New York Times, (2020); WMA Statement on the Ethics of Telemedicine, (2018); Botrugno C., Towards an ethics for telehealth, Nurs Ethics, 26, pp. 357-367, (2019); Raposo V.L., Telemedicine: the legal framework (or the lack of it) in Europe, GMS Health Technol Assess, 12, (2016); Davenport T., Kalakota R., The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare, Future Healthc J, 6, pp. 94-98, (2019); Topol E.J., Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again, (2019); Obermeyer Z., Emanuel E.J., Predicting the future - big data, machine learning, and clinical medicine, N Engl J Med, 375, pp. 1216-1219, (2016); Babic B., Gerke S., Evgeniou T., Cohen I.G., Direct-to-consumer medical machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, Nat Mach Intell, 3, pp. 283-287, (2021); Topol E.J., High-performance medicine: the convergence of human and artificial intelligence, Nat Med, 25, pp. 44-59, (2019); Topol E.J., Individualized medicine from prewomb to tomb, Cell, 157, pp. 241-253, (2014); Anthes E., The shape of work to come, Nature, 550, pp. 316-319, (2017); Nedelkoska L., Glenda Q., Automation, skills use and training, (2018); Etzioni A., Etzioni O., Incorporating ethics into artificial intelligence, J Ethics, 21, pp. 403-418, (2017); Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, (2019); Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) for Self-Assessment, (2020); Courtland R., Bias detectives: The researchers striving to make algorithms fair news-feature, Nature, 558, pp. 357-360, (2018); Digital E.T.F., Trustworthy AI in health, (2020); Ghassemi M., Naumann T., Schulam P., Beam A.L., Chen I.Y., Ranganath R., Practical guidance on artificial intelligence for health-care data, Lancet Digit Health, 1, pp. e157-e159, (2019); Cohen I.G., Evgeniou T., Gerke S., Minssen T., The European artificial intelligence strategy: implications and challenges for digital health, Lancet Digit Health, 2, pp. e376-e379, (2020); Zaner R.M., The phenomenon of trust and the patient-physician relationship.

Through an IoT ecosystem, core elements and their importance or meaning can be defined. In IoT-aware smart devices, smart sensors operate together over the Internet with limited or without human intervention. M2M (machine-to-machine) communication was the early stage of IoT in this Internet world. As IoT develops, it is using big innovations, including a vast array of statistical knowledge, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, to deal with large data and computations. This inquiry continues with an outline of the taxonomy of the IoT ecosystem. This chapter has formulated an overview of the IoT environment which illustrates IoT architecture, gateways, nodes, middleware, OS’s, framework, protection, storage and computation, communication or networking technologies of IoT, and interfaces for the efficient utilization of data in an ecosystem. This chapter moreover illustrates the hierarchy of the intelligence of the IoT ecosystem, which describes the process of generation of data, derivation of desired information from those raw data, processing, and manipulation. Collaborations between IoT and evolving technologies have been developed, including data processing (e.g., the use of machine learning algorithms), cloud, fog, and edge computing. Furthermore, several frameworks to ensure the security of data and the IoT ecosystem were elaborated based on machine learning. Finally, the chapter describes some applications of IoT that are growing faster. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Architecture; Cloud computing; Data analytics; IoT ecosystem; Machine learning","Cloud computing; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Middleware; Security of data; Advanced technology; Cloud-computing; Core elements; Data analytics; Ecosystem functioning; Health care education; Human intervention; Information and knowledge structures; IoT ecosystem; Smart devices; Internet of things","","","","","","","Moore S.J., Nugent C.D., Zhang S., Et al., IoT reliability: A review leading to 5 key research directions, CCF Trans.

These include digital twins and virtual patients for in silico clinical trials, both of which seek to transform research and health care by speeding innovation and bridging the epistemic gap between population-based research findings and their application to the individual. Nevertheless, digital simulacra mark a major milestone on a trajectory to embrace the epistemic culture of data science and a potential abandonment of medical epistemological concepts of causality and representation. In doing so, “data first” approaches potentially shift moral attention from actual patients and principles, such as equity, to simulated patients and patient data. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","artificial intelligence; big data; digital twins; epistemic rights; virtual patients","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Computer Simulation; Humans; adult; article; artificial intelligence; attention; big data; biomedicine; computer model; controlled study; data science; digital twin; health status; human; morality; patient coding; prediction; responsibility; simulation; big data; computer simulation","","","","","National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH; National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI","This work was supported by National Institute of Mental Health; National Human Genome Research Institute.","Alsdurf B., (2021); Amarasingham R., Audet A.M.J., Bates D.W., Cohen I.G., Entwistle M., Escobar G.J., Liu V., Etheredge L., Lo B., Ohno-Machado L., Et al., Consensus statement on electronic health predictive analytics: A guiding framework to address challenges, Generating Evidence & Methods to Improve Patient Outcomes, 4, 1, (2016); Angus D.C., Randomized clinical trials of artificial intelligence, JAMA, 323, 11, pp. 1043-1045, (2020); Baillargeon B., Rebelo N., Fox D.D., Taylor R.L., Kuhl E., The living heart project: A robust and integrative simulator for human heart function, European Journal of Mechanics –A/Solids, 48, pp. 38-47, (2014); Baird C., Calvard T.S., Epistemic vices in organizations: Knowledge, truth, and unethical conduct, Journal of Business Ethics, 160, 1, pp. 263-276, (2019); Batten J.N., How stratification unites ethical issues in precision health, AMA Journal of Ethics, 20, 9, pp. 798-803, (2018); Batty M., Digital twins, Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science, 45, 5, pp. 817-820, (2018); (2020); Bjornsson B., Borrebaeck C., Elander N., Gasslander T., Gawel D.R., Gustafsson M., Jornsten R., Lee E.J., Li X., Lilja S., Digital twins to personalize medicine, Genome Medicine, 12, 1, (2020); Bloomfield P.S., Clutton-Brock P., Pencheon E., Magnusson J., Karpathakis K., Artificial Intelligence in the NHS: Climate and Emissions✰,✰✰, The Journal of Climate Change and Health, 4, (2021); Bodner J., Kaul V., A framework for in silico clinical trials for medical devices using concepts from model verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ), American Society of Mechanical Engineers Digital Collection, (2021); Braun M., Represent me: Please!

It puts some light on the limitless scope of AI in healthcare today and what it will bring to the platter tomorrow. Change is the fact of life and advanced technology and tech-savvy personnel have successfully brought that in the form of AI platforms which work wonders in almost every sector. Moreover, AI gained its hype through the revolutionary switch to big data simplifying the discipline of applied science. A brief history, fundamentals, applications, future scope and recent developments where AI turned out to be bliss are broadly covered in the next few pages. Knowledge on yet another domain known as Health economics and outcome research plus real-world studies and how it utilizes AI is penned down as well. In recent scenarios, AI is used in almost every dimension be it education, IT, agriculture, gaming etc. but is bringing a paradigm shift in the healthcare sector in particular. A true boost to the utilization of AI in healthcare is being provided by Pharmacia-informatics in an exceptionally well manner. The chapter aims in highlighting the role of AI during Covid-19 as well. AI’s exceptional push in medical imaging, wearable devices, virtual nursing aid, virtual clinical trial, AI-assisted surgery, prescription auditing, brand management, pricing of drugs and risk control have been avidly elucidated. On-demand AI systems like IBM Watson and other AI systems are superficially illustrated. Mystifying concepts of Artificial intelligence, Machine learning and deep learning are presented in a comparative yet unadorned manner. With numerous opportunities come challenges which are keenly annotated. We conclude with the verity that AI is a mere re-engineering of the human mind and cannot match human intelligence, there are debates and always competition between AI and HI but in actuality, AI is a mere redesigning of the human mind.","Artificial Intelligence; Deep learning; Healthcare; Machine learning; Medicine","","","","","","","","Rajaraman V., John McCarthy — Father of artificial intelligence, Resonance [Internet], 19, 3, pp. 198-207, (2014); Dick S., Artificial Intelligence, Harvard Data Science Review [Internet], 1, 1, (2019); Mesko B., The role of artificial intelligence in precision medicine, Expert Review of Precision Medicine and Drug Development, 2, 5, pp. 239-241, (2017); Kaul V., Enslin S., Gross S.A., History of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, 92, 4 Oct, pp. 807-812, (2020); Bohr A., Memarzadeh K., The rise of artificial intelligence in healthcare applications, Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare, pp. 25-60, (2020); Jiang F., Jiang Y., Zhi H., Dong Y., Li H., Ma S., Wang Y., Dong Q., Shen H,∙Wang Y.

Digital health (DH) is nowadays fundamental for physicians. Despite the improvement of information and communications technology (ICT), Italian medical doctors' (MDs) education system seems inadequate in this area. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, societies are waking up to their limitations. The aim of this paper is to analyze the Italian status quo in DH. Methods. The Italian Young Medical Doctors Association (Segretariato Italiano Giovani Medici - SIGM) proposed a web-based survey to assess DH awareness and previous knowledge among young doctors. Investigated areas were: big data, -omics technology and predictive models, artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things, telemedicine, social media, blockchain and clinical-data storage. Results. A total of 362 participants answered to the survey. Only 13% had experience in big data during clinical or research activities, 13% in -omics technology and predictive models, 13% in AI, 6% had experience in internet of things, 22% experienced at least one telemedicine tool and 23% of the participants declared that during their clinical activities data collection was paper-driven. Conclusions. Three categories of MDs, high-tech, low-tech and no-tech, can be identified from the survey-based investigation. Our survey's results indicate an urgent need for integration of pre- and post-graduation training in digital health to provide adequate medical education. © 2021 Istituto Superiore di Sanita.

This is a transdisciplinary research and extension project that engages multidisciplinary scientists, dairy farmers, and industry professionals. Dairy farms have embraced large and diverse technological innovations such as sensors and robotic systems, and procured vast amounts of constant data streams, but they have not been able to integrate all this information effectively to improve whole-farm decision making. Consequently, the effects of all this new smart dairy farming are not being fully realized. It is imperative to develop a system that can collect, integrate, manage, and analyze on- and off-farm data in real time for practical and relevant actions. We are using the state-of-the-art database management system from the University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for High Throughput Computing to develop our Agricultural Data Hub that connects and analyzes cow and herd data on a permanent basis. This involves cleaning and normalizing the data as well as allowing data retrieval on demand. We illustrate our Dairy Brain concept with 3 practical applications: (1) nutritional grouping that provides a more accurate diet to lactating cows by automatically allocating cows to pens according to their nutritional requirements aggregating and analyzing data streams from management, feed, Dairy Herd Improvement (DHI), and milking parlor records; (2) early risk detection of clinical mastitis (CM) that identifies first-lactation cows under risk of developing CM by analyzing integrated data from genetic, management, and DHI records; and (3) predicting CM onset that recognizes cows at higher risk of contracting CM, by continuously integrating and analyzing data from management and the milking parlor. We demonstrate with these applications that it is possible to develop integrated continuous decision-support tools that could potentially reduce diet costs by $99/cow per yr and that it is possible to provide a new dimension for monitoring health events by identifying cows at higher risk of CM and by detecting 90% of CM cases a few milkings before disease onset. We are securely advancing toward our overarching goal of developing our Dairy Brain. This is an ongoing innovative project that is anticipated to transform how dairy farms operate. © 2020 American Dairy Science Association","artificial intelligence; continuous data integration; Dairy Brain; decision-making tools; optimization; simulation","Animals; Big Data; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Computer Systems; Dairying; Decision Making; Diet; Female; Humans; Lactation; Longitudinal Studies; Mastitis, Bovine; Milk; Nutritional Requirements; animal; bovine; bovine mastitis; cattle disease; computer system; dairying; decision making; diet; economics; female; genetics; human; lactation; longitudinal study; milk; nutritional requirement; pathophysiology; procedures; veterinary medicine","","","","","USDA-NIFA-FACT, (2019-68017-29935); University of Wisconsin-Madison, UW"," This project is supported by the University of Wisconsin-Madison UW2020 initiative that encourages highly innovative and groundbreaking research.

However, the implementation of electronic health records (EHR) in hospitals is increasing rapidly, accelerated by the meaningful use initiatives associated with the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services EHR Incentive Programs. The transition to electronic medical records and availability of patient data has been associated with increases in the volume and complexity of patient information, as well as an increase in medical alerts, with resulting ""alert fatigue"" and increased expectations for rapid and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, these increased demands on health care providers create greater risk for diagnostic and therapeutic errors. In the near future, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning will likely assist physicians with differential diagnosis of disease, treatment options suggestions, and recommendations, and, in the case of medical imaging, with cues in image interpretation. Mining and advanced analysis of ""big data"" in health care provide the potential not only to perform ""in silico"" research but also to provide ""real time"" diagnostic and (potentially) therapeutic recommendations based on empirical data. ""On demand"" access to high-performance computing and large health care databases will support and sustain our ability to achieve personalized medicine. The IBM Jeopardy! Challenge, which pitted the best all-time human players against the Watson computer, captured the imagination of millions of people across the world and demonstrated the potential to apply AI approaches to a wide variety of subject matter, including medicine. The combination of AI, big data, and massively parallel computing offers the potential to create a revolutionary way of practicing evidence-based, personalized medicine. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York (outside the USA).","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Cardiac imaging; Electronic health records; IBM's Watson; Neural networks; Personalized medicine","Artificial Intelligence; Cardiac Imaging Techniques; Diffusion of Innovation; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Individualized Medicine; Neural Networks (Computer); access to information; article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; cardiac imaging; decision support system; doctor patient relation; electronic medical record; evidence based medicine; factual database; health care cost; health care delivery; human; image processing; machine learning; medical informatics; patient information; personalized medicine; positron emission tomography; single photon emission computer tomography; mass communication; methodology; review","","","","","International Business Machines Corporation, IBM","Conflict of Interest Steven E.

In environmental epidemiology, exposure modeling is a commonly used approach to conduct exposure assessment to determine the distribution of exposures in study populations. geoAI technologies provide important advantages for exposure modeling in environmental epidemiology, including the ability to incorporate large amounts of big spatial and temporal data in a variety of formats; computational efficiency; flexibility in algorithms and workflows to accommodate relevant characteristics of spatial (environmental) processes including spatial nonstationarity; and scalability to model other environmental exposures across different geographic areas. The objectives of this commentary are to provide an overview of key concepts surrounding the evolving and interdisciplinary field of geoAI including spatial data science, machine learning, deep learning, and data mining; recent geoAI applications in research; and potential future directions for geoAI in environmental epidemiology. © 2018 The Author(s).","Data mining; Deep learning; Environmental epidemiology; Exposure modeling; geoAI; Geospatial artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Spatial data science","Artificial Intelligence; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; artificial intelligence; data mining; ecosystem health; environmental quality; innovation; machine learning; remote sensing; spatial data; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution; artificial intelligence; data extraction; data mining; environmental exposure; geographic information system; geospatial artificial intelligence; health hazard; human; information processing; machine learning; priority journal; remote sensing; Review; environmental exposure; environmental health; environmental monitoring; procedures","","","","","Training Program in Cancer Epidemiology; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Cancer Institute, NCI, (T32CA009001); Prevent Cancer Foundation, PCF","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Training Program in Cancer Epidemiology (T32 CA009001) and the Prevent Cancer Foundation.","Li S., Dragicevic S., Castro F.A., Sester M., Winter S., Coltekin A., Pettit C., Jiang B., Haworth J., Stein A., Geospatial big data handling theory and methods: A review and research challenges, ISPRS J Photogramm Remote Sens, 115, pp. 119-133, (2016); Industry Insights: 2.5 Quintillion Bytes of Data Created Every Day; Baker D., Nieuwenhuijsen M.J., Environmental Epidemiology: Study Methods and Application; Lin Y., Chiang Y.-Y., Pan F., Stripelis D., Ambite J.L., Eckel S.P., Habre R., Mining public datasets for modeling intra-city PM2.5 concentrations at a fine spatial resolution, Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems.

PGHD include self-reported health and treatment histories, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and biometric sensor data. Advances in wireless technology, smartphones, and the Internet of Things have facilitated new ways to collect PGHD during clinic visits and in daily life. The goal of the current review was to provide an overview of the current clinical, regulatory, technological, and analytic landscape as it relates to PGHD in oncology research and care. The review begins with a rationale for PGHD as described by the US Food and Drug Administration, the Institute of Medicine, and other regulatory and scientific organizations. The evidence base for clinic-based and remote symptom monitoring using PGHD is described, with an emphasis on PROs. An overview is presented of current approaches to digital phenotyping or device-based, real-time assessment of biometric, behavioral, self-report, and performance data. Analytic opportunities regarding PGHD are envisioned in the context of big data and artificial intelligence in medicine. Finally, challenges and solutions for the integration of PGHD into clinical care are presented. The challenges include electronic medical record integration of PROs and biometric data, analysis of large and complex biometric data sets, and potential clinic workflow redesign. In addition, there is currently more limited evidence for the use of biometric data relative to PROs. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of PGHD make them increasingly likely to be integrated into oncology research and clinical care. © 2020 American Cancer Society","neoplasms; patient-generated health data; quality of life; telemedicine","Artificial Intelligence; Biomedical Research; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Medical Oncology; Morbidity; Neoplasms; United States; artificial intelligence; big data; biometry; cancer research; data mining; diet; evidence based practice; Food and Drug Administration; functional status; health care need; health care organization; health care planning; health care quality; human; language processing; medical care; medical record; oncology; patient care; patient-reported outcome; phenotype; physical activity; priority journal; Review; self report; sleep; telemonitoring; workflow; artificial intelligence; health care delivery; medical research; morbidity; neoplasm; procedures; United States","","","","","National Cancer Institute, NCI, (K01CA211789, P30CA076292, R01CA214647, R01CA219389)","","What are patient-generated health data?; Shapiro M., Johnston D., Wald J., Mon D., Patient-generated health data.

However, there is no comprehensive review on the topic specifically on service design for the fields of public health and public administration. Based on the current discussions on the value of design for public health and public administration, the paper presents a systematic literature review into the specific discussions on service design, with the purpose to provide better public service innovations, especially in the context of recognizing the human needs in the technological digital advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, and Cloud Computing. The paper outlines the areas of applications, issues, and challenges for future research and policy innovations. By analyzing top keywords and authors from 529 articles, collected from the Web of Science database, the scientometric study reveals an emerging loose network of concepts and authors. Although the impact of such work remains limited at its early stage of development, the combination of both human-centered insights and system thinking processes at the organization levels, brought by the service design approach, has shown to tackle some of the wicked problems of public health and public administration. Future research and design workshops can be conducted to reinvigorate the notion of people-centered commitments for public service innovations, with societal relevance and scientific rigor. © 2020 IEEE.","Digital economy; E-government; Local government; Public goods; Public services; Service design","Artificial intelligence; Economic and social effects; Public health; Design workshops; Innovative solutions; ITS applications; Public services; System thinkings; Systematic literature review; Value of designs; Wicked problems; Public administration","","","","","Age of New Business, Arts and Engineering Disciplines, (2019GXJK186); SMEs in Guangdong, (2018WTSCX215)","The research is funded partly by a project of Research on Promoting Good E-Governance for Supporting Positive Development of SMEs in Guangdong (2018WTSCX215), and partly by a project of Smart App Design Innovation in the Age of New Business, Arts and Engineering Disciplines (2019GXJK186), respectively under the 2018 and 2019 Guangdong Education Grants, China.","Designing for Public Services, (2016); Service Design, (2020); Design and Public Services-Government Digital Service, (2013); The Scottish Approach to Service Design (SAtSD), (2020); Data and Public Services Toolkit, (2019); Wang Z., Liao H.-T., Zhou Y., Pang S., Towards the design of sociotechnical systems for sustainability: A scientometric analysis, ICHSSR 2020, Hangzhou, China, (2020); Borst M., Digital transformation: An ieee digital reality initiative white paper, IEEE Digital Reality Initiative, (2020); Garfield E., Research Fronts, (2020); Boletta M., New Web of Science Categories Reflect Ever-evolving Research, (2019); Jarneving B., Bibliographic coupling and its application to research-front and other core documents, Journal of Informetrics, 1, 4, pp. 287-307, (2007); Rabetino R., Kohtamaki M., Gebauer H., Strategy map of servitization, International Journal of Production Economics, 192, pp. 144-156, (2017); Ayala N.F., Paslauski C.A., Ghezzi A., Frank A.G., Knowledge sharing dynamics in service suppliers' involvement for servitization of manufacturing companies, International Journal of Production Economics, 193, pp. 538-553, (2017); Wang Z., Chen C.-H., Zheng P., Li X., Khoo L.P., A graph-based context-aware requirement elicitation approach in smart product-service systems, International Journal of Production Research, pp. 1-17, (2019); Rymaszewska A., Helo P., Gunasekaran A., IoT powered servitization of manufacturing-an exploratory case study, International Journal of Production Economics, 192, pp. 92-105, (2017); Ardolino M., Rapaccini M., Saccani N., Gaiardelli P., Crespi G., Ruggeri C., The role of digital technologies for the service transformation of industrial companies, International Journal of Production Research, 56, 6, pp. 2116-2132, (2018); Yang H.-L., Hsiao S.-L., Mechanisms of developing innovative ITenabled services: A case study of Taiwanese healthcare service, Technovation, 29, 5, pp. 327-337, (2009); Faust O., Lei N., Chew E., Ciaccio E.J., Acharya U.R., A smart service platform for cost efficient cardiac health monitoring, IJERPH, 17, 17, (2020); Yoon S.N., Lee D., Artificial intelligence and robots in healthcare: What are the success factors for technology-based service encounters?, International Journal of Healthcare Management, 12, 3, pp. 218-225, (2019); Chowdhury H.M.M., Quaddus M.A., A multi-phased QFD based optimization approach to sustainable service design, International Journal of Production Economics, 171, pp. 165-178, (2016); Barber K.D., Beach R., Zolkiewski J., Environmental sustainability: A value cycle research agenda, Production Planning & Control, 23, 2-3, pp. 105-119, (2012); Gomes E., Bustinza O.F., Tarba S., Khan Z., Ahammad M., Antecedents and implications of territorial servitization, Regional Studies, 53, 3, pp. 410-423, (2019)","H.-T.

These mechanical and digital devices are all connected by a robust network to transfer the real-time data to a cloud where the information are processed to position, trace, monitor, administer and manage the desired change. In doing so, the parameters get tuned, and once the guidelines are added in these smart devices, the human reliance is eliminated for the subsequent guidance. The IoT infra is a combination of multiple technologies, using machine learning real-time analytics, commodity sensors and embedded systems using radio frequency identification (RFID). IoT exploits the discoveries and innovations in the area of networking, artificial intelligence, big data and data networking to achieve functionality, flexibility and efficiency in almost all day today fields. IoT enhances the digital experience; artificial intelligence algorithm and interconnected networks power it.

The landscape of the field will differ depending on the time period being looked at and would no doubt include conjecture. Initial breakthroughs will need to pave the way for future medical technology and apply to the surgical sciences. Within the next 10 years we would expect to see the emergence of big data analysis, cuttingedge image processing techniques for surgical planning and better implementation of virtual and augmented reality in operating theatres for both patient care and teaching purposes. Over the next 50 to 100 years, the use of quantum computing should lead to increased automation in our healthcare systems. The inception of novel biomaterial invention and advanced genetic engineering will usher in the new age of regenerative medicine in the clinical setting. The future of surgery includes many predictions and promises, but it is apparent that the development will lead to bettering outcome and focus on patient care. © 2019","Innovation; Medical Technology; Surgery","artificial intelligence; bioprinting; computer prediction; CRISPR-CAS9 system; DNA modification; futurology; genetic engineering; health care system; human; image processing; machine learning; nanomedicine; patient care; priority journal; regenerative medicine; Review; robot assisted surgery; surgical science; teaching; three dimensional imaging","","","","","","","Yates D.M., Turing's Legacy: A History of Computing at the National Physical Laboratory 1945-1995, (1997); Sutton G.P., Biblarz O., Rocket Propulsion Elements, (2011); Quero G., Lapergola A., Soler L., Shabaz M., Hostettler A., Collins T., Et al., Virtual and augmented reality in oncologic liver surgery, Surg.

Laboratory automation and the linkage of information systems for big(ger) data management, including artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, also are being introduced. The initial optimism associated with these developments has now entered a more reality-driven phase of reflection on the significant challenges, complexities, and health care benefits posed by these innovations. With this in mind, the ongoing process of clinical laboratory consolidation, covering large geographical regions, represents an opportunity for the efficient and cost-effective introduction of new laboratory technologies and improvements in translational research and development. This will further define and generate the mandatory infrastructure used in validation and implementation of newer high-throughput diagnostic approaches. Effective, structured access to large numbers of well-documented biobanked biological materials from networked laboratories will release countless opportunities for clinical and scientific infectious disease research and will generate positive health care impacts. We describe why consolidation of clinical microbiology laboratories will generate quality benefits for many, if not most, aspects of the services separate institutions already provided individually. We also define the important role of innovative and large-scale diagnostic platforms. Such platforms lend themselves particularly well to computational (AI)-driven genomics and bioinformatics applications. These and other diagnostic innovations will allow for better infectious disease detection, surveillance, and prevention with novel translational research and optimized (diagnostic) product and service development opportunities as key results. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Biobanking; Clinical microbiology; Consolidation; Surveillance","Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Clinical Laboratory Services; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Communicable Diseases; Humans; artificial intelligence; automation; biobank; bioinformatics; clinical laboratory; clinical outcome; health care policy; health care quality; health maintenance organization; health service; high volume hospital; hospital design; human; infection; laboratory automation; medical microbiology; medical technology; practice guideline; private hospital; public-private partnership; Review; rural hospital; translational research; urban hospital; animal; clinical laboratory service; communicable disease; laboratory technique; organization and management; procedures","","","","","Groupement Hospitalier Universitaire de Bruxelles; International Agency for Research on Cancer/WHO; University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UCLH","Funding text 1: in the automation sections of the manuscript.

Keralty organization is already working on developing an intelligent big data analytic platform based on machine learning and data integration principles. We discuss how this platform is the new pillar for the organization to improve population health management, value-based care, and new upcoming challenges in healthcare. The benefits of using this new data platform for community and population health include better healthcare outcomes, improvement of clinical operations, reducing costs of care, and generation of accurate medical information. Several machine learning algorithms implemented by the authors can use the large standardized datasets integrated into the platform to improve the effectiveness of public health interventions, improving diagnosis, and clinical decision support. The data integrated into the platform come from Electronic Health Records (EHR), Hospital Information Systems (HIS), Radiology Information Systems (RIS), and Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), as well as data generated by public health platforms, mobile data, social media, and clinical web portals. This massive volume of data is integrated using big data techniques for storage, retrieval, processing, and transformation. This paper presents the design of a digital health platform in a healthcare organization in Colombia to integrate operational, clinical, and business data repositories with advanced analytics to improve the decision-making process for population health management. © 2020 by the authors.","Big data; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Machine learning; Personalized patient care; Population health management","Data integration; Decision making; Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Digital storage; Health care; Information systems; Information use; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Metadata; Population statistics; Portals; Predictive analytics; Public health; Clinical decision support; Decision making process; Electronic health record; Healthcare organizations; Hospital information systems; Laboratory information system; Medical decision supports; Radiology information system; Information management","","","","","Sanitas USA","This document presents an independent study supported by the company Sanitas USA.

It is premised on extreme digital connectivity to build smart factories and deliver extreme automation in science and society. Industry 4.0 has recently scaled up worldwide beyond Germany and Europe. Industry 4.0 employs the Internet of Things (IoT) to connect, communicate, and collect big data from embedded sensors in living and inanimate objects. When we add artificial intelligence (AI) powered real-time data analyses to the IoT, a state of worldwide extreme connectivity, or ""The Quantified Planet,"" is created. By its focus on connectivity at a systems scale, the Industry 4.0 is of interest to health products manufacturing and service automation in medicine, biology, ecology, and society. But there are also unchecked assumptions. This article poses a question that has so far been neglected in the Industry 4.0 innovation echo chamber. Is it always good to have pervasive connectivity and extreme integration to the point that ""everything is connected to everything else""? For example, extreme connectivity creates an ""All Your Eggs in One Basket"" problem and thus potential for complete network collapse in a domino effect when a component in a highly integrated system fails. Digital connectivity cultivates a fertile ground for new social and political power structures for authoritarian governance (i.e., a worrisome state of ""pansurveillance"") by one person in total control of knowledge networks in science and society, directly or through connected proxies. Filter bubbles created by extreme digital connectivity and AI can result in compressed foresight, lackluster innovation, and monocultures in laboratory life. The way forward is to harness Industry 4.0 and connectivity without such digital network toxicity. Similar to fire exits in skyscrapers and other built environments, designing innovation systems with extreme connectivity demands that we also think of ""exit plans"" from the omnipresent digital networks, IoT, and The Quantified Planet-both for safety and sustained creativity. Finally, the relationship between new technologies and society is far from being a simple one-directional interaction; it is not the technologies that cause social disruption. On the contrary, it is the value-loaded decisions made by individuals, organizations, and other social actors that shape sociotechnical change. Recognizing the latter narrative is important because it informs how we do science and can best respond to uncertainties and opaque assumptions embedded in emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, and Industry 4.0. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Artificial intelligence; Critical policy studies; Industry 4.0; Sensors; The Internet of Things; The Quantified Planet","Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Germany; Humans; Industry; Internet; Inventions; Uncertainty; Article; artificial intelligence; automation; Germany; human; Internet; medical technology; national health service; priority journal; artificial intelligence; automation; industry; Internet; invention; trends; uncertainty","","","","","","","Benessia A., Funtowicz S., Giampietro M., Et al., The Rightful Place of Science: Science on the Verge, (2016); Collingridge D., The Social Control of Technology, (1980); Didier C., Duan W., Dupuy J.P., Et al., Acknowledging AI's dark side, Science, 349, pp. 1064-1065, (2015); Feyerabend P.K., The Tyranny of Science, (2011); Fisher E., Responsible innovation in a post-truth moment, J Respons Innov, 4, pp. 1-4, (2017); Floyd P., The Dark Side of the Moon, (1973); Foucault M., Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings, 1972-1977, (1980); Gabbal A., Kevin Ashton Describes ""the Internet of Things."" the Innovator Weighs in on What Human Life Will Be Like a Century from Now, (2015); Guston D., The Muddled Legacy of Alvin Toffler, (2016); Guston D.H., Sarewitz D., Miller C., Scientists not immune to partisanship, Science, 323, (2009); Haraway D., Situated knowledges: The science question in feminism and the privilege of partial perspectives, Fem Stud, 14, pp. 575-599, (1988); Hern A., Gibbs S., What Is WannaCry ransomware and Why Is It Attacking Global Computers?, The Guardian, (2017); Hyman L., It's Not Technology That's Disrupting Our Jobs, New York Times, (2018); Kagermann H., Wahlster W., Helbig J., Securing the Future of German Manufacturing Industry.

Already, AI is having an impact on healthcare, and new prospects of far greater advances open up daily. This paper sets out how AI can bring new precision to care, with benefits for patients and for society as a whole. But it also sets out the conditions for realizing the potential: key issues are ensuring adequate access to data, an appropriate regulatory environment, action to sustain innovation in research institutes and industry big and small, promotion of take-up of innovation by the healthcare establishment, and resolution of a range of vital legal and ethical questions centred on safeguarding patients and their rights. For Europe to fulfil the conditions for success, it will have to find a new spirit of cooperation that can overcome the handicaps of the continent's fragmented technical and legal landscape. The start the European Union has made shows some ambition, but a clearer strategic vision and firmer plans for implementation will be needed. The European Alliance for Personalised Medicine (EAPM) has listed its own priorities: data, integrating innovation into care, building trust, developing skills and constructing policy frameworks that guarantee infrastructure, equitable access, and legal clarity. © 2019 S.

A vast amount of data is generated in different sectors of healthcare industry: data from hospitals and healthcare providers, medical insurance, medical equipment, life sciences and medical research. With the advancement in technology, there is a huge potential for utilization of this data for transforming healthcare. The application of analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence over big data enables identification of patterns and correlations and hence provides actionable insights for improving the delivery of healthcare. There have been many contributions to the literature in this topic, but we lack a comprehensive view of the current state of research and application. This paper focuses on assessing the available literature in order to provide the researchers with evidence that enable fostering further development in this area. A systematic mapping study was conducted to identify and analyze research on big data analytics and artificial intelligence in healthcare, in which 2421 articles between 2013 and February 2019 were evaluated. The results of this study will help understand the needs in application of these technologies in healthcare by identifying the areas that require additional research. It will hence provide the researchers and industry experts with a base for future work. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Big data analytics; Healthcare; Machine learning; Systematic map","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Delivery of Health Care; Organizational Innovation; Advanced Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data Analytics; Health care; Learning systems; Machine learning; Mapping; Health care providers; Healthcare industry; Industry experts; Medical insurance; Medical research; State of research; Systematic mapping studies; Systematic maps; artificial intelligence; big data; health care delivery; human; machine learning; review; algorithm; organization; organization and management; Metadata","","","","","","","Raghupathi W., Raghupathi V., Big data analytics in healthcare: promise and potential, Heal.

One of the ways in dealing with these changes is the establishment of Learning Health Systems (LHS) in which healthcare systems are aligned with continuous improvement and innovation from scientific, informatics, incentives, and culture aspects and knowledge about best practices is consistently captured, assimilated, and embedded within the system. However, despite the fact that the adoption of LHS is a multi-perspective one, there is not enough literature on the multidimensionality of this topic. This paper aims to identify and look into the different perspectives that have effects on the learning health system adoption in U.S by conducting PEST strategic analysis as an initial step towards a more multidimensional look into this topic. © 2018 IEEE.","Continuous Improvement; Healthcare; Learning Health Systems; Quality Improvement; Strategic Analysis","Artificial intelligence; Diagnosis; Embedded systems; Health care; Learning systems; Metadata; Object oriented programming; Continuous improvements; Disruptive innovations; Health systems; Health-care system; Healthcare institutions; Multidimensionality; Quality improvement; Strategic analysis; Quality control","","","","","","","Ginter P., Duncan W., Swayne L., Strategic Management of Health Care Organizations, (2013); Santilli J., Randy Vogenberg F., Key strategic trends that impact healthcare decision-making and stakeholder roles in the new marketplace, Am.

Recent scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements have improved our understanding of disease pathogenesis and changed the way we diagnose and treat disease leading to more precise, predictable and powerful health care that is customized for the individual patient. Genetic, genomics, and epigenetic alterations appear to be contributing to different diseases. Deep clinical phenotyping, combined with advanced molecular phenotypic profiling, enables the construction of causal network models in which a genomic region is proposed to influence the levels of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. Phenotypic analysis bears great importance to elucidat the pathophysiology of networks at the molecular and cellular level. Digital biomarkers (BMs) can have several applications beyond clinical trials in diagnostics - to identify patients affected by a disease or to guide treatment. Digital BMs present a big opportunity to measure clinical endpoints in a remote, objective and unbiased manner. However, the use of “omics” technologies and large sample sizes have generated massive amounts of data sets, and their analyses have become a major bottleneck requiring sophisticated computational and statistical methods. With the wealth of information for different diseases and its link to intrinsic biology, the challenge is now to turn the multi-parametric taxonomic classification of a disease into better clinical decision-making by more precisely defining a disease. As a result, the big data revolution has provided an opportunity to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to this vast data set. The advancements in digital health opportunities have also arisen numerous questions and concerns on the future of healthcare practices in particular with what regards the reliability of AI diagnostic tools, the impact on clinical practice and vulnerability of algorithms. AI, machine learning algorithms, computational biology, and digital BMs will offer an opportunity to translate new data into actionable information thus, allowing earlier diagnosis and precise treatment options. A better understanding and cohesiveness of the different components of the knowledge network is a must to fully exploit the potential of it. © 2019 The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases;

Since then, the development of artificial intelligence has in part been shaped by the field of neuroscience. By understanding the human brain, scientists have attempted to build new intelligent machines capable of performing complex tasks akin to humans. Indeed, future research into artificial intelligence will continue to benefit from the study of the human brain. While the development of artificial intelligence algorithms has been fast paced, the actual use of most artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in biomedical engineering and clinical practice is still markedly below its conceivably broader potentials. This is partly because for any algorithm to be incorporated into existing workflows it has to stand the test of scientific validation, clinical and personal utility, application context, and is equitable as well. In this context, there is much to be gained by combining AI and human intelligence (HI). Harnessing Big Data, computing power and storage capacities, and addressing societal issues emergent from algorithm applications, demand deploying HI in tandem with AI. Very few countries, even economically developed states, lack adequate and critical governance frames to best understand and steer the AI innovation trajectories in health care. Drug discovery and translational pharmaceutical research stand to gain from AI technology provided they are also informed by HI. In this expert review, we analyze the ways in which AI applications are likely to traverse the continuum of life from birth to death, and encompassing not only humans but also all animal, plant, and other living organisms that are increasingly touched by AI. Examples of AI applications include digital health, diagnosis of diseases in newborns, remote monitoring of health by smart devices, real-time Big Data analytics for prompt diagnosis of heart attacks, and facial analysis software with consequences on civil liberties. While we underscore the need for integration of AI and HI, we note that AI technology does not have to replace medical specialists or scientists and rather, is in need of such expert HI. Altogether, AI and HI offer synergy for responsible innovation and veritable prospects for improving health care from prevention to diagnosis to therapeutics while unintended consequences of automation emergent from AI and algorithms should be borne in mind on scientific cultures, work force, and society at large. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Artificial intelligence;

In particular, the third SDG focuses on the need to ""ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages"". In this paper, we build the case that 5G wireless technology, along with concomitant emerging technologies (such as IoT, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning), will transform global healthcare systems in the near future. Our optimism around 5G-enabled healthcare stems from a confluence of significant technical pushes that are already at play: apart from the availability of high-throughput low-latency wireless connectivity, other significant factors include the democratization of computing through cloud computing; the democratization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing (e.g., IBMWatson); and the commoditization of data through crowdsourcing and digital exhaust. These technologies together can finally crack a dysfunctional healthcare system that has largely been impervious to technological innovations. We highlight the persistent deficiencies of the current healthcare system and then demonstrate how the 5G-enabled healthcare revolution can fix these deficiencies. We also highlight open technical research challenges, and potential pitfalls, that may hinder the development of such a 5G-enabled health revolution. © 2017 by the authors.","5G; Artificial intelligence and machine learning; Big data analytics; Healthcare; Internet of Things","5G mobile communication systems; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Engineering education; Internet of things; Learning systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Cognitive Computing; Data analytics; Emerging technologies; Health-care system; Low-latency wireless connectivity; Technical research; Technological innovation; Wireless technologies; Health care","","","","","","","McGinnis J.M., Stuckhardt L., Saunders R., Smith M., (Eds.)

However, the concepts of Big Data (BD) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can still be interpreted in various ways. Clinical laboratories are certainly among the health care organizations producing an important number of data that can be considered BD and it is certainly not a coincidence that they are among the first health organizations to have implemented computer systems within their workflows. Through a process called Data Mining it is possible to extract useful information from BD using automatic or semi-automatic methods that must be preceded by Data Cleaning in order to ensure the cleanliness and correctness of the data themself. Regarding Data Analysis, several Machine Learning or Deep Learning techniques based on different algorithms or on the functioning principle of neural networks can be used; for the development of these techniques, R and Python programming languages are really useful. Although many applications can be useful in Laboratory Medicine, there are still some obstacles to overcome, including poor harmonization of data or fragmentation of sources; moreover, the issue of data accessibility must be managed considering patient's privacy as a priority. Finally, there is an increase apprehension related to the awareness of the inevitable innovation in the Laboratory Medicine field in the near future, because of these new approaches. To face these challenges, it is necessary that these topics become familiar to the professionals of Laboratory Medicine. Aim of this Document is to share information about BD and AI in order to contribute to the introduction and development of these methodologies in the field of Laboratory Medicine. © 2021 Biomedia.

Recent research and experience have shone further light on factors influencing the implementation and usefulness of these approaches, as well as unresolved challenges and unintended consequences. These are considered in relation to not only digital technology and infrastructure, but also wider aspects of health systems, the nature of primary care work and culture, patient characteristics and inequalities, and ethical issues around data privacy, inclusion, empowerment, empathy and trust. Implications for the future direction and sustainability of these approaches are discussed, taking account of novel paradigms, such as artificial intelligence, and the growing capture of primary care data for secondary uses. Decision makers are encouraged to think holistically about where value is most likely to be added, or risks being taken away, when judging which innovations to carry forward. It concludes that, while responding to this public health emergency has created something of a digital ‘big bang' for primary care, an incremental, adaptive, patient-centered strategy, focused on augmenting rather than replacing existing services, is likely to prove most fruitful in the longer term. © 2021 THE AUTHOR(S).

The field of personalized medicine stands to benefit from new technologies so as to harness the omics big data, for example, to individualize and accelerate cancer diagnostics and therapeutics in particular. In this overarching context, breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide with multiple underlying molecular etiologies and each subtype displaying diverse clinical outcomes. Disease stratification for breast cancer is, therefore, vital to its effective and individualized clinical care. The support vector machine (SVM) is a rising machine learning approach that offers robust classification of high-dimensional big data into small numbers of data points (support vectors), achieving differentiation of subgroups in a short amount of time. Considering the rapid timelines required for both diagnosis and treatment of most aggressive cancers, this new machine learning technique has important clinical and public applications and implications for high-throughput data analysis and contextualization. This expert review describes and examines, first, the SVM models employed to forecast breast cancer subtypes using diverse systems science data, including transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics, and radiomics, as well as biological pathway, clinical, pathological, and biochemical data. Then, we compare the performance of the present SVM and other diagnostic and therapeutic prediction models across the data types. We conclude by emphasizing that data integration is a critical bottleneck in systems science, cancer research and development, and health care innovation and that SVM and machine learning approaches offer new solutions and ways forward in biomedical, bioengineering, and clinical applications. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Algorithms and clinical decision-making; Breast cancer; Health care robots; Machine learning; Personalized medicine; Support Vector Machines","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Breast Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Precision Medicine; Support Vector Machine; proteome; transcriptome; breast cancer; cancer research; epigenetics; histopathology; human; machine learning; personalized medicine; priority journal; proteomics; radiomics; Review; support vector machine; transcriptomics; algorithm; artificial intelligence; biology; breast tumor; female; machine learning; personalized medicine; procedures; support vector machine","","","","","","","Agner S.C., Rosen M.A., Englander S., Et al., Computerized image analysis for identifying triple-negative breast cancers and differentiating them from other molecular subtypes of breast cancer on dynamic contrast-enhanced MR images: A feasibility study, Radiology, 272, pp. 91-99, (2014); Akkus A., Guvenir H.A., K nearest neighbor classification on feature projections, Proc ICML, 1, pp. 12-19, (1996); Alag A., Machine learning approach yields epigenetic biomarkers of food allergy: A novel 13-gene signature to diagnose clinical reactivity, PLoS One, 14, (2019); Becker-Putsche M., Bocklitz T., Clement J., Rosch P., Popp J., Toward improving fine needle aspiration cytology by applying Raman microspectroscopy, J Biomed Opt, 18, (2013); Bray F., Ferlay J., Soerjomataram I., Siegel R.L., Torre L.A., Jemal A., Global cancer statistics 2018: Globocan estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries, CA Cancer J Clin, 68, pp. 394-424, (2018); Coates A., Winer E.P., Goldhirsch A., Et al., Tailoring therapies- improving the management of early breast cancer: St gallen international expert consensus on the primary therapy of early breast cancer 2015, Ann Oncol, 26, pp. 1533-1546, (2015); Dabney A., Storey J., Optimality driven nearest centroid classification from genomic data, PLoS One, 2, (2007); Dayton C., Logistic Regression Analysis.

It is observed that the use of big data architecture and techniques are continuously assisting in managing the expeditious data growth in healthcare industry. Here, initially an empirical study is performed to analyze the role of big data in healthcare industry. It has been observed that significant work has been done using big data in healthcare sector. Nowadays, it is intricate to envision the way the machine learning and big data can influence the healthcare industries. It has been observed that most of the authors who implemented the use of machine learning and big data analytics in disease diagnosis have not given significant weightage to the privacy and security of the data. Here, a novel design of smart and secure healthcare information system using machine learning and advanced security mechanism has been proposed to handle big data of medical industry. The innovation lies in the incorporation of optimal storage and data security layer used to maintain security and privacy. Different techniques like masking encryption, activity monitoring, granular access control, dynamic data encryption and end point validation have been incorporated. The proposed hybrid four layer healthcare model seems to be more effective disease diagnostic big data system. © 2018 The Authors.

Many companies are leading the transformation toward Industry 4.0 based on innovation by Cyber-Physical System (CPS). CPS Systems integrate computation, networking and physical processes that will provide new functionalities to improve quality of life and enable technological advances in critical areas. Besides CPS, transformative technologies impacting Industry 4.0 are Machine-to-machine learning, Big-Data analysis, Cloud computing, Mobile internet, Autonomous vehicles and advanced materials. Industry 4.0 is also influenced by extensive application of Enhanced Visualization and Simulation, Additive Manufacturing, Smart Automation and Augmented Reality. The combination of Internet technologies and future-oriented technologies in (machines & products) based on advanced digitalization results in a new fundamental paradigm shift in Industry. This paper includes a case study demonstrating the impact of Industry 4.0-including the integration of CPS in Human Balance and Rehabilitation Engineering. Growing health care needs have seen the introduction of Artificial intelligence and data science integrated into tele-sensing of vital signs. Sensory perception and model-based decision making has helped the study of human gait to assist in balance. This case study involves impaired populations involving stroke survivors, fall-prone elderly, vestibular loss sufferers and amputees using an ambulatory suspension system. The case study demonstrates the use of sensory perception, data collection and the use of body support system such as an Ambulatory Suspension System for decision making on balance. These technologies are reordering the global industry structure, creating new markets, products, improving labor productivity and driving growth in advanced economies. These technologies have enormous impacts on predictive maintenance, improved decision-making in real-time, real-time inventory and improved flexibility among jobs. © 2019, IEOM Society International.","Ambulatory suspension system; Cyber-physical systems; Internet of things","","","","","","","","","","","IEOM Society","EATON Powering Business worldwide; Sheridan; SIEMENS; UNIVERSITY of DERBY; UNIVERSITY of Windsor","4th North American IEOM Conference.

Risks to privacy and justice/equity are discussed, along with potential solutions. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper highlights the scale and scope of PHI data consumed by deep learning algorithms and their opacity as novel challenges to health data governance. Findings: This paper argues that these characteristics of machine learning will overwhelm existing data governance approaches such as privacy regulation and informed consent. Enhanced governance techniques and tools will be required to help preserve the autonomy and rights of individuals to control their PHI. Debate among all stakeholders and informed critique of how, and for whom, PHI-fueled health AI are developed and deployed are needed to channel these innovations in societally beneficial directions. Social implications: Health data may be used to address pressing societal concerns, such as operational and system-level improvement, and innovations such as personalized medicine. This paper informs work seeking to harness these resources for societal good amidst many competing value claims and substantial risks for privacy and security. Originality/value: This is the first paper focusing on health data governance in relation to AI/machine learning. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Deep learning;

The workshop was dedicated to bring together experts with diverse backgrounds but with one common goal: to understand intelligence for the successful design, development and evaluation of algorithms that can learn from data, extract knowledge from experience, and to improve their learning behaviour over time – similarly as we humans do. Knowledge discovery, data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence are more or less synonymously used with no strict definitions or boundaries. “Integrative” means to support not only the machine learning & knowledge extraction pipeline, ranging from dealing with data in arbitrarily high-dimensional spaces to the visualization of results into a lower dimension accessible to a human; it is taking into account seemingly disparate fields which can be very fruitful when brought together - for solving problems in complex application domains (e.g. health informatics). Here we want to emphasize that the most important findings in machine learning will be those we do not know yet. In this paper we provide: (1) a short motivation for the integrative approach; (2) brief summaries of the presentations given in Banff; and (3) some personally flavoured, subjective future research outlooks, e.g. in the combination of geometrical approaches with machine learning. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Integrative machine learning; Knowledge discovery","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Data visualization; Extraction; Learning systems; Complex applications; Geometrical approaches; Health informatics; High dimensional spaces; International researches; Knowledge discovery and data minings; Knowledge extraction; Data mining","","","","","","","Bengio Y., Learning deep architectures for AI, Found.

Right from drug discovery to personalized medicine, digital patients and patient engagement, there is great consideration of technology at each step. Methods: The published data and online information available is reviewed to give an overview of digitization in pharma, across the drug development cycle, industry collaborations and innovations. The regulatory guidelines, innovative collaborations across industry, academics and thought leadership are presented. Also included are some ideas, suggestions, way forwards while digitizing the pharma neurons, the regulatory stand, benefits and challenges. Results: The innovations range from discovering personalized medicine to conducting virtual clinical trials, and maximizing data collection from the real-world experience. To address the increasing demand for the real-world data and the needs of tech-savvy patients, the innovations are shaping up accordingly. Pharma companies are collaborating with academics and they are co-innovating the technology for example Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s program. This focuses on the modernization of clinical trials, strategic use of artificial intelligence and machine learning using real-world evidence, assess the risk-benefit ratio of deploying digital analytics in medicine, and proactively identifying the solutions.

The gigantic progressions and rapid transformation of human societies have endorsed legitimacy of abundant data, multiple dynamic variables and critical complexities which reinforce the academia and researchers for understanding and pioneering into ‘Big Data Analytics (BDA)'. Health is one of the vibrant socio-economic variables which have correlations with other aspects of life, that is, education, poverty, income, etc. In fact, there are unending debates whether health can be a basic input for a holistic developmental process or it is the outcome of various developmental factors. BDAs are being used across various sectors of the economy. The developed nations have been yielding most feasible solutions using various forms of analysis of big data. Astronomical research has been using a large quantum of data for accomplishing various satellite projects, space technology, and numerous space missions for the astronaut. With the advent of fourth industrial revolution, the world community has been thriving toward a new age technological innovations that include artificial intelligence, machine learning, block chain technology, etc., which act a pivotal tool for BDAs. In the health sector, application of BDAs has been attempted and experimented in the developed nations which have resulted prolific and sustainable solutions to the most typical cumbersome problems. This chapter has demonstrated how BDAs can make progressive reforms in the Indian Health sector outlining the present status and emerging challenges. © 2020 Emerald Publishing Limited.","achievement; Big data analytics; challenges; health care; India; progressive reforms","","","","","","","","Adhikary T., Jana A.D., Chakrabarty A., Jana S.K., The internet of things (IoT) augmentation in healthcare: An application analytics, International conference on intelligent computing and communication technologies, pp. 576-583, (2019); Big Data Analytics/IBM, (2019); Barnes T.J., Big data, little history, Dialogues in Human Geography, 3, 3, pp. 297-302, (2013); Bloom D.E., Kuhn M., Prettner K., Health and economic growth, (2018); Chakrabarty A., Is India poised for M-commerce in the cashless milieu?, M-commerce experiencing the phygital retail, pp. 205-216, (2019); Chakravorti B., Bhalla A., Chaturvedi R.S., Which countries are leading the data economy?, Harvard Business Review, (2019); Ciuriak D., The knowledge-based and data-driven economy: Quantifying the impacts of trade agreements, (2017); Ciuriak D., The Knowledge-based and Data-driven Economy Quantifying the Impacts of Trade Agreements, (2017); Ciuriak D., The economics of data: Implications for the data-driven economy, (2018); Cox M., Ellsworth D., Application-controlled demand paging for out-of-core visualization, Proceedings of visualization, pp. 235-244, (1997); Dandona R., Pandey A., Dandona L., A review of national health surveys in India, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 94, 4, (2016); Deming W.E., Out of the crisis, 1986, (1991); Eide E.R., Showalter M.H., Estimating the relation between health and education: What do we know and what do we need to know?, Economics of Education Review, 30, 5, pp. 778-791, (2011); Finlay J., The role of health in economic development, (2007); Hilbert M., Lopez P., The world’s technological capacity to store, communicate, and compute information, Science, 332, 6025, pp. 60-65, (2011); Horgan D., Romao M., Torbett R., Brand A., European data-driven economy: A lighthouse initiative on personalised medicine, Health Policy and Technology, 3, 4, pp. 226-233, (2014); Lammi M., Pantzar M., The data economy: How technological change has altered the role of the citizen-consumer, Technology in Society, 59, (2019); Laney D., 3D data management: Controlling data volume, velocity and variety, Meta Group Research Note, 6, 70, (2001); Performance for All India (Across State), Child Health; Family Planning; Maternal Health; Financial Year: 2019-2020, (2019); Key Indicators of Social Consumption in India: Health, (2015); Health in India, 71st Round, (2016); Opher A., Onda A., Chou A., Sounderrajan K., The rise of the data economy: Driving value through internet of things data monetization, (2016); Press G., A very short history of big data, Forbes Tech Magazine, (2013); (2005); Russom P., Big data analytics, TDWI Best Practices Report, Fourth Quarter, 19, 4, pp. 1-34, (2011)","","","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.","","","","","","","978-183909099-8; 978-183909100-1","","","English","Big Data Analytics and Intelligence: A Perspective for Health Care","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144404527"

Clinicians, however, usually lack the necessary training for the analysis of large databases. In addition, there are issues referred to patient privacy and consent, and data quality. Multidisciplinary collaboration among clinicians, data engineers, machine-learning experts, statisticians, epidemiologists and other information scientists may overcome these problems. A multidisciplinary event (Critical Care Datathon) was held in Madrid (Spain) from 1 to 3 December 2017. Under the auspices of the Spanish Critical Care Society (SEMICYUC), the event was organized by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Critical Data Group (Cambridge, MA, USA), the Innovation Unit and Critical Care Department of San Carlos Clinic Hospital, and the Life Supporting Technologies group of Madrid Polytechnic University. After presentations referred to big data in the critical care environment, clinicians, data scientists and other health data science enthusiasts and lawyers worked in collaboration using an anonymized database (MIMIC III). Eight groups were formed to answer different clinical research questions elaborated prior to the meeting. The event produced analyses for the questions posed and outlined several future clinical research opportunities. Foundations were laid to enable future use of ICU databases in Spain, and a timeline was established for future meetings, as an example of how big data analysis tools have tremendous potential in our field. © 2018 Elsevier España, S.L.U. y SEMICYUC","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Clinical databases; Collaborative work; Datathon; Machine learning; MIMIC III","Big Data; Critical Care; Critical Illness; Databases, Factual; Humans; Interdisciplinary Research; Machine Learning; Spain; adult; article; artificial intelligence; clinical research; controlled study; data analysis; epidemiologist; human; intensive care unit; lawyer; machine learning; Massachusetts; medical information system; privacy; randomized controlled trial (topic); scientist; Spain; critical illness; factual database; intensive care; interdisciplinary research; organization and management; procedures","","","","","","","Morris G.G.R., Computer applications, Principles of critical care, pp. 500-514, (1992); Ghassemi M., Celi L.A., Stone D.J., State of the art review: the data revolution in critical care, Crit Care, 19, (2015); Celi L.A., Csete M., Stone D., Optimal data systems: the future of clinical predictions and decision support, Curr Opin Crit Care, 20, pp. 573-580, (2014); Takaki J., Petersen T., Ericson G.; Gu S., Wu Q.; Brownlee J.; Celi L.A., Mark R.G., Stone D.J., Montgomery R.A., “Big data” in the intensive care unit.

While change is everywhere, performance has flatlined: 60% of care on average is in line with evidence- or consensus-based guidelines, 30% is some form of waste or of low value, and 10% is harm. The 60-30-10 Challenge has persisted for three decades. Main body: Current top-down or chain-logic strategies to address this problem, based essentially on linear models of change and relying on policies, hierarchies, and standardisation, have proven insufficient. Instead, we need to marry ideas drawn from complexity science and continuous improvement with proposals for creating a deep learning health system. This dynamic learning model has the potential to assemble relevant information including patients' histories, and clinical, patient, laboratory, and cost data for improved decision-making in real time, or close to real time. If we get it right, the learning health system will contribute to care being more evidence-based and less wasteful and harmful. It will need a purpose-designed digital backbone and infrastructure, apply artificial intelligence to support diagnosis and treatment options, harness genomic and other new data types, and create informed discussions of options between patients, families, and clinicians. While there will be many variants of the model, learning health systems will need to spread, and be encouraged to do so, principally through diffusion of innovation models and local adaptations. Conclusion: Deep learning systems can enable us to better exploit expanding health datasets including traditional and newer forms of big and smaller-scale data, e.g. genomics and cost information, and incorporate patient preferences into decision-making. As we envisage it, a deep learning system will support healthcare's desire to continually improve, and make gains on the 60-30-10 dimensions. All modern health systems are awash with data, but it is only recently that we have been able to bring this together, operationalised, and turned into useful information by which to make more intelligent, timely decisions than in the past. © 2020 The Author(s).","Change; Clinical networks; Complexity; Complexity science; Evidence-based care; Healthcare systems; Learning health system; Patient safety; Policy; Quality of care","Delivery of Health Care; Health Policy; Humans; Quality of Health Care; adult; artificial intelligence; decision making; deep learning; genomics; human; learning health system; local adaptation; logic; mass communication; patient preference; patient safety; review; standardization; health care delivery; health care policy; health care quality","","","","","","","Braithwaite J., Changing how we think about healthcare improvement, BMJ, 361, (2018); Braithwaite J., Hibbert P.D., Jaffe A., Et al., Quality of health care for children in Australia, 2012-2013, JAMA, 319, 11, pp. 1113-1124, (2018); Mangione-Smith R., Decristofaro A.H., Setodji C.M., Keesey J., Klein D.J., Adams J.L., Schuster M.A., McGlynn E.A., The quality of ambulatory care delivered to children in the United States, N Engl J Med, 357, 15, pp. 1515-1523, (2007); McGlynn E.A., Asch S.M., Adams J., Keesey J., Hicks J., Decristofaro A., Kerr E.A., The quality of health care delivered to adults in the United States, N Engl J Med, 348, 26, pp. 2635-2645, (2003); Runciman W.B., Hunt T.D., Hannaford N.A., Hibbert P.D., Westbrook J.I., Coiera E., Day R.O., Hindmarsh D.M., McGlynn E.A., Braithwaite J., CareTrack: Assessing the appropriateness of healthcare delivery in Australia, Med J Aust, 197, 2, pp. 100-105, (2012); Steel N., Bachmann M., Maisey S., Shekelle P., Breeze E., Marmot M., Melzer D., Self reported receipt of care consistent with 32 quality indicators: National population survey of adults aged 50 or more in England, BMJ, 337, (2008); Berwick D.M., Hackbarth A.D., Eliminating waste in US health care, JAMA, 307, 14, pp. 1513-1516, (2012); Tackling Wasteful Spending on Health, (2017); Saini V., Brownlee S., Elshaug A.G., Glasziou P., Heath I., Addressing overuse and underuse around the world, Lancet, 390, 10090, pp. 105-107, (2017); Saini V., Garcia-Armesto S., Klemperer D., Paris V., Elshaug A.G., Brownlee S., Ioannidis J.P.A., Fisher E.S., Drivers of poor medical care, Lancet, 390, 10090, pp. 178-190, (2017); Baker G.R., Norton P.G., Flintoft V., Blais R., Brown A., Cox J., Etchells E., Ghali W.A., Hebert P., Majumdar S.R., Et al., The Canadian Adverse Events Study: The incidence of adverse events among hospital patients in Canada, CMAJ, 170, 11, pp. 1678-1686, (2004); Brennan T.A., Leape L.L., Laird N.M., Hebert L., Localio A.R., Lawthers A.G., Newhouse J.P., Weiler P.C., Hiatt H.H., Incidence of adverse events and negligence in hospitalized patients, N Engl J Med, 324, 6, pp. 370-376, (1991); Vincent C., Neale G., Woloshynowych M., Adverse events in British hospitals: Preliminary retrospective record review, BMJ, 322, 7285, pp. 517-519, (2001); Wilson R.M., Runciman W.B., Gibbert R.W., Harrison B.T., Newby L., Hamilton J.D., The quality in Australian health care study, Med J Aust, 163, 9, pp. 458-471, (1995); Crossing the Global Quality Chasm: Improving Health Care Worldwide, (2018); Braithwaite J., Hollnagel E., Hunte G.S., Resilient Health Care Volume 5: Working across Boundaries, (2019); Li J.W., Morway L., Velasquez A., Weingart S.N., Stuver S.O., Perceptions of medical errors in cancer care: An analysis of how the news media describe sentinel events, J Patient Saf, 11, 1, pp. 42-51, (2015); Chester A.N., Penno E.C., Gauld R.D., A media content analysis of New Zealand's district health board population-based funding formula, N Z Med J, 17, 131, pp. 38-49, (2018); Delivering Quality Health Services: A Global Imperative for Universal Health Coverage, (2018); Kruk M.E., Gage A.D., Arsenault C., Et al., High-quality health systems in the Sustainable Development Goals era: Time for revolution, The Lancet Global Health Commission on High Quality Health Systems in the SDG Era, pp. PE1196-PE1252, (2018); Shojania K.G., Sampson M., Ansari M.T., Ji J., Doucette S., Moher D., How quickly do systematic reviews go out of date?

The author argues that the announcement of the pandemic determined an unprecedented situation: humanity faces a completely different concept of reality. In particular, the breakthrough in the development of NBIC technologies (nano, bio, new information and cognitive technologies) contributes to the strengthening of the paradigm that absolutizes the technocratic component of civilizational development. Under the general depression and decline in economic activity, there is an explosive growth in the field of bioengineering, information and cognitive research. The ‘new normality’ of the coronavirus era, associated with the unprecedented development of artificial intelligence systems, video surveillance technologies, geolocation and ‘big data’, in an unusually short time has created new existential and legal problems. The proclaimed threat to public health, being a significant goal-setting, has become a dominant justification for the introduction of serious innovations that allow the ruling elites to block civil rights, in particular, to legalize the use of tracking systems. Under the fight against the pandemic, the personal identification systems based on advanced technologies are being transformed from a security tool of law enforcement agencies into a tool of mass social engineering. Russia has come close to a new stage of digital transformation — a state-wide credential management system (the Unified Federal Information Register). Considering the experience of China in digital segregation, concerns arise: will digitalization turn into something dangerous as the algorithms of artificial intelligence improve, the use of biometric surveillance broaden, etc.? The article emphasizes that scanning the appearance and collecting information about citizens allows to create a gigantic array of data, the use of which can have unpredictable consequences, and the problem of their unauthorized use is not the main one. The power of algorithms, which allows to manipulate a person by means of continuously collected information about him, can turn into a new, sophisticated form of genocide. © 2021, RUDN UNiversity.

However, the status of kidney health care needs to be strengthened globally and research evidence in nephrology is relatively limited. The unmet needs in nephrology leave ample space for imagination regarding leveraging big data and artificial intelligence (AI). Big data has potential to drive medical innovation, reduce medical costs and improve health care quality. Compared with other specialties such as cardiology, the scopes of utilizing big data in nephrology need to be enhanced. We reviewed the studies on the application of big data in nephrology, such as disease surveillance, risk prediction and clinical decision support systems (CDSS), and proposed several potential directions of utilizing big data and AI. The efforts including building a CKD surveillance system and collaborative network, implementing a real-world cohort in a cost-effective manner, strengthening the application and transformation of AI and CDSS, and stimulating the activeness of medical imaging in nephrology, could be considered. In the era of big data, a nephrologist would be stronger and smarter if he or she could get intelligent assistance from knowledge or big data-driven CDSS. © 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology","artificial intelligence; big data; chronic kidney disease; clinical decision support system","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Humans; Nephrology; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; acute kidney failure; air pollution; artificial intelligence; big data; chronic kidney failure; clinical decision support system; diagnostic imaging; disease surveillance; electronic health record; end stage renal disease; human; kidney biopsy; machine learning; nephrology; particulate matter; prediction; priority journal; privacy; Review","","carbon monoxide, 630-08-0; nitrogen dioxide, 10102-44-0","","","National Key R&D Program of the; Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, CCTS, UTHealth, (BMU20160466, BMU2018JI012, BMU2019JI005); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (81301296, 81771938, 91846101); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST, (2016YFC1305400); Peking University, PKU, (BMU2018MX020, PKU2017LCX05); Peking University Third Hospital, PUTH, (2018SF069)","This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91846101, 81771938, 81301296), the National Key R&D Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (2016YFC1305400), the University of Michigan Health System-Peking University Health Science Center Joint Institute for Translational and Clinical Research (BMU20160466, BMU2018JI012, BMU2019JI005), the Scientific Research Seed Fund of Peking University First Hospital (2018SF069), and from Peking University (BMU2018MX020, PKU2017LCX05).","Couser W.G., Remuzzi G., Mendis S., Tonelli M., The contribution of chronic kidney disease to the global burden of major noncommunicable diseases, Kidney Int., 80, pp. 1044-1045, (2012); Barsoum R.S., Chronic kidney disease in the developing world, N.

As new drugs are the major source of medical innovation, informatics-related concepts and techniques are a major source of digital medical innovation. However, it is unclear whether the research efforts of medical informatics in China have met the health needs, such as disease management and population health. Objective: We proposed an approach to mapping the interplay between different knowledge entities by using the tree structure of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to gain insights into the interactions between informatics supply, health demand, and technological applications in digital medical innovation in China. Methods: All terms under the MeSH tree parent node “Diseases [C]” or node “Health [N01.400]” or “Public Health [N06.850]” were labelled as H. All terms under the node “Information Science [L]” were labelled as I, and all terms under node “Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]” were labelled as T. The H-I-T interactions can be measured by using their co-occurrences in a given publication. Results: The H-I-T interactions in China are showing significant growth and a more concentrated interplay were observed. Computing methodologies, informatics, and communications media (such as social media and the internet) constitute the majority of I-related concepts and techniques used for resolving the health promotion and diseases management problems in China. Generally there is a positive correlation between the burden and informatics research efforts for diseases in China. We think it is not contradictory that informatics research should be focused on the greatest burden of diseases or where it can have the most impact. Artificial intelligence is a competing field of medical informatics research in China, with a notable focus on diagnostic deep learning algorithms for medical imaging. Conclusions: It is suggested that technological transfers, namely the functionality to be realized by medical/health informatics (eg, diagnosis, therapeutics, surgical procedures, laboratory testing techniques, and equipment and supplies) should be strengthened. Research on natural language processing and electronic health records should also be strengthened to improve the real-world applications of health information technologies and big data in the future. © Jian Du, Ting Chen, Luxia Zhang.

Risk file. This mission can only be achieved under conscious leadership based on an advanced strategy that supports the culture of innovation and new practices, managed by leaders capable of making investment decisions for the city. According to previous literature and hundreds of research studies to study this phenomenon in accelerated areas of life, the new technological development has not been comprehensively kept pace with the building of a smart city based on its structure on a vision and the big data system (Chen et al., 2012), in line with creative thinking and strategic leadership for the quality of investment decisions and innovative expectations that have become a vital and indispensable component. For the continuation and prosperity of the organization's activity. Therefore, the United Arab Emirates attaches great importance to concerted efforts in ensuring a better life for future generations, directly affecting people's lives, such as health, education and the economy. In addition to the state’s keenness to build global partnerships. To enhance the utilization of the unprecedented services provided by artificial intelligence technologies, and their role in improving human life, which transcends geographical borders to include the entire world. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to study the relationship between the concept of a smart city, the objectives of building and analyzing its motives, and to clarify the technologies that support the city, and how to face the problems and challenges caused by big data for smart cities. In addition to the application of strategic leadership practices as the mainstay of development and the real wealth of the nation to bring about change and development, and the need to focus on the quality of investment decisions, and this task is not achieved except under conscious leadership based on an advanced strategy that supports the culture of innovation and new practices. © 2021, Allied Business Academies.

The information age environment has provided unprecedented new opportunities and challenges for the creative space. To realize the intelligence of the creative space, we need to do a good job in the following four aspects of the response. First of all, the development of creative space should focus on and break through the key technologies of AI, combine with the needs of users, combine the technological achievements of external artificial intelligence, give full play to artificial intelligence talents and technological advantages, and tap the greatest value of the creative space. Secondly, the foundation and core of the creative space service is all kinds of raw materials, tools and resources of innovative products, and the use of artificial intelligence technology should also serve the resource construction and management of space. By integrating the tool materials required by the founders with modern intelligent analysis, we continue to enrich the variety of materials and lay the resource base for enhancing the creative services of the genesis space. Third, artificial intelligence technology is a new technology, in order to ensure that artificial intelligence technology in the creative space services play a real role, we must strengthen the construction of human resources, the introduction and training of high-end talent has become a new need for intelligent applications. In addition, we can use advanced artificial intelligence equipment to optimize the space planning and management of the Creative Space. Space design should be reasonable science, intelligent space and intelligent products combined, hardware equipment to meet the needs of big data, can support big data storage and computing services and operating systems, etc. In order to adapt to the development and application of artificial intelligence, we should do a good job in artificial intelligence technology, resource intelligent management technology, related personnel integration, intelligent space re-engineering four aspects of the response measures. Increase investment in construction, as soon as possible to apply artificial intelligence in the creative space, in order to provide the founders with a better quality of modern creation. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Application; Artificial intelligence; Creative space","Big data; Computation theory; Digital storage; Ergonomics; Health risks; Human resource management; Information management; Product design; Risk management; Safety engineering; Storage as a service (STaaS); Artificial intelligence technologies; Development and applications; Development strategies; Intelligent applications; Intelligent management; Personalized information; Science and Technology; Technological innovation; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","","Xin G., The application of artificial intelligence in university libraries, Inside outside Lantai, 7, pp. 47-49, (2020); Liu W., Create a New Driving Back Scene under the University Students Create a New Industry Education Building Research-To Tianjin City High School Public Creating Space as an Example, pp. 94-99, (2018); Chen D., Comparative and Propulsion Strategy Research on the Development Model of Crowd-Creative Space, Straits Science, 5, pp. 3-5, (2016)","B.L.

This is due to the convergence of various advancements related to digitalization and the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs)—ranging from the internet of things (IoT) and the internet of medical things (IoMT) to the fields of robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and massively parallel and cloud computing. Further progress has been made in the fields of addictive manufacturing and three-dimensional (3D) printing, sophisticated statistical tools such as big data visualization and analytics (BDVA) and artificial intelligence (AI), the use of mobile and smartphone applications (apps), remote monitoring and wearable sensors, and e-learning, among others. Within this new conceptual framework, big data represents a massive set of data characterized by different properties and features. These can be categorized both from a quantitative and qualitative standpoint, and include data generated from wet-lab and microarrays (molecular big data), databases and registries (clinical/computational big data), imaging techniques (such as radiomics, imaging big data) and web searches (the so-called infodemiology, digital big data). The present review aims to show how big and smart data can revolutionize gynecology by shedding light on female reproductive health, both in terms of physiology and pathophysiology. More specifically, they appear to have potential uses in the field of gynecology to increase its accuracy and precision, stratify patients, provide opportunities for personalized treatment options rather than delivering a package of “one-size-fits-it-all” healthcare management provisions, and enhance its effectiveness at each stage (health promotion, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics). © 2021 by the authors.

Globally, particularly in emerging economies, the high burden of musculoskeletal conditions and their contribution to multimorbidity continue to rise, as does the gap for services to deliver essential care. There is a growing need to find solutions to this challenge and deliver person-centred and integrated care, wherein empowering patients with the capacity for self-management is critical. Whilst there is an abundance of information available online to support consumer education, the number of sources for credible medical information is diluted by uninformed anecdotal social media solutions. Even with the provision of high-quality information, behavioural change does not necessarily follow, and more robust educational approaches are required. In this chapter, we examine innovation, its management and the strategic directions required to improve musculoskeletal healthcare at macro (policy), meso (service delivery) and micro (clinical practice) levels. We discuss the critical role of consumer agency (patients and their families/carers) in driving innovation and the need to leverage this through empowerment by education. We provide a snapshot of real-world examples of innovative practices including capacity building in consumer and interprofessional musculoskeletal education and practice; recommendations to transform the access and delivery of integrated, person-centred care; and initiatives in musculoskeletal care and implementation of models of care, enabled by digital health solutions including telehealth, remote monitoring, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and big data. We provide emerging evidence for how innovation can support systems' strengthening and build capacity to support improved access to ‘right’ musculoskeletal care, and explore some of the ways to best manage innovations. We conclude with recommended systematic steps to establish required leadership, collaboration, research, networking, dissemination, implementation and evaluation of future innovations in musculoskeletal health and care. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative learning; Delivery of healthcare; Health workforce; Integrated; Musculoskeletal diseases; Patient-centred care; Self-management; Technology transfer; Telemedicine","Artificial Intelligence; Delivery of Health Care; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Self Care; Telemedicine; behavior change; consumer; economic aspect; empowerment; health care; health care access; health care delivery; health care planning; health care quality; health service; human; medical education; medical information; multiple chronic conditions; musculoskeletal disease; musculoskeletal system; priority journal; Review; self care; social media; artificial intelligence; musculoskeletal disease; telemedicine","","","","","","","James S.L., Abate D., Abate K.H., Et al., Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 354 diseases and injuries for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, Lancet, 392, 10159, pp. 1789-1858, (2018); World Health Organization, Musculoskeletal conditions, (2019); Chehade M.J., Gill T.K., Kopansky-Giles D., Et al., Building multidisciplinary health workforce capacity to support the implementation of integrated, people-centres Models of Care for musculoskeletal health, BPRCR, 30, pp. 559-584, (2016); Dominick C.H., Blyth F.M., Nicholas M.K., Unpacking the burden: understanding the relationships between chronic pain and comorbidity in the general population, Pain, 153, 2, pp. 293-304, (2012); Greenhalgh T., Robert G., Bate P., Et al., How to spread good ideas.

CPS blurs the boundaries between the physical and virtual worlds, and creates a dynamic digital map of all things in existence that can be analyzed in ways that are much more sophisticated than a bar code scanning system. Examples of CPS include self-driving cars, wearables for digital monitoring of heart arrhythmias, industrial AI-powered robots in smart factories and health robots delivering home care services to disabled persons and rural communities. Another interesting prospect of digital health powered by AI, IoT, and CPS is remote phenotypic data capture and characterization of pharmaceutical outcomes in clinical trials in ways that are user centric and meaningful to patients. For rural or remote communities with limited access to medical product information, the IoT could bring about pharmacy and health services innovation. There are unprecedented societal challenges at intersections of digital health with AI, IoT, and CPS as well. For example, the physical and virtual worlds markedly differ in speed, scale, and temporalities, as do our physical self and digital footprints. Our efforts to map and develop effective solutions to societal corollaries of AI, IoT, and CPS need to bear in mind such asymmetries between the physical and virtual worlds. A societal issue such as privacy may emerge in different forms and intensities in the physical and virtual contexts. Digital data are highly fluid and can rapidly move across spaces and places, whereas the physical data and humans are much slower and exist in different scales than our digital footprints. It is therefore timely for the system sciences and integrative biology communities to critically engage with digital health and the related technologies, such as AI, IoT, and CPS. © Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2019.","artificial intelligence; automation; CPS; cyber-physical systems; digital health; IoT","Artificial Intelligence; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Humans; Internet; Public Health; Telemedicine; algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; big data; biomedicine; cyber physical system; digital health; health; health care delivery; health science; human; information processing; internet of things; knowledge; priority journal; society; technology; artificial intelligence; diagnostic test; Internet; procedures; public health; telemedicine","","","","","","","Aerts H.J.W.L., Data science in radiology: A path forward, Clin Cancer Res, 24, pp. 532-534, (2018); Bayram M., Asxar R., Ozdemir V., Is space the new frontier for omics?

From the moment patients come into contact with the health care system, their entire medical history is recorded electronically. Whether a patient is in the operating room or on the hospital ward, technological advancement has facilitated the expedient and reliable measurement of clinically relevant health metrics, all in an effort to guide care and ensure the best possible clinical outcomes. However, as the volume and complexity of biomedical data grow, it becomes challenging to effectively process ""big data"" using conventional techniques. Physicians and scientists must be prepared to look beyond classic methods of data processing to extract clinically relevant information. The purpose of this article is to introduce the modern plastic surgeon to machine learning and computational interpretation of large data sets. What is machine learning? Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, can address clinically relevant problems in several domains of plastic surgery, including burn surgery; microsurgery; and craniofacial, peripheral nerve, and aesthetic surgery.

The Amazon Echo and its intelligent personal assistant, 'Alexa', is a leading innovation in this area. This novel research examines aspects of trust and privacy relating to personal use of the Echo. It aims to demonstrate the types of data that may be vocally extracted from a selection of the multitude of applications that may be linked to the Echo. In the era of Voice IoT, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, trust and privacy concerns are paramount for the individual. Personal data has never been more valuable, both to large reputable corporations and to criminal groups. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) came into force in May 2018, aiming to protect the privacy of personal data of EU citizens. This has further highlighted the trust issues stemming from this technological medium. This paper demonstrates that a typically configured Echo device can prove to be a vulnerable channel by which personal information may be accessed. Where no safeguards are implemented, a plethora of data including personal identifiable information and personal health information is available from the device. Data exposure by simple vocal request leaves the system vulnerable to inquisition by any unauthorized individual who is within 'ear shot' of the device. The research explores the extent to which these risks can be reduced or mitigated, offering a set of recommendations aimed at building trust and preserving user privacy, while still enabling functionality of the device. Trust and privacy are based on a triad of shared responsibility. While the GDPR enforces trust between the voice service providers and the consumers, adherence to these recommendations will empower individuals to trust against privacy breaches from local sources. © 2019 IEEE.","Amazon Echo; GDPR; Personal Data; Privacy; Voice Command Devices","Computer networks; Historic preservation; Natural language processing systems; Amazon Echo; GDPR; General data protection regulations; Leading innovations; Personal health informations; Personal information; Shared responsibility; Voice command; Data privacy","","","","","","","Lopez G., Quesada L., Guerrero L.A., Alexa vs. Siri vs. Cortana vs. Google assistant: A comparison of speech-based natural user interfaces, Advances in Human Factors and Systems Interaction, 592, (2018); Weinstein J.N., Artificial Intelligence: Have You Met Your New Friends, (2019); Blue J., Furey E., Condell J., A novel approach for secure identity authentication in legacy database systems, 28th Irish Signals and Systems Conference (ISSC), (2017); Isaak J., Hanna M.J., User data privacy: Facebook, Cambridge analytica, and privacy protection, Computer, 51, 8, pp. 56-5917, (2018); 679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the Protection of Natural Persons with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data, and Repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), (2016); Boughman E., Is There An Echo in Here?

Nowadays it is a well developed and structured multidisciplinary field that reflects developments and advances of biomedical research based on principles of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine (PPPM/3PM). All these trends in PPPM progress have to be translated into practice and education of new generation of scientists and healthcare givers. The importance of biobanks for multitasking research, personalised treatment, and health care systems was emphasised by many scientists and health care experts. As biobanking carries multidisciplinary character currently including more professionals than ten—twenty years ago, new generation of professional biobankers is urgently needed. To create new generation of biobankers who are fully competent to answer more and more scientific and practical questions, new study programmes, novel university curricula, and topic-dedicated courses are essential. The aim of the review is to present basic forms, trends of biobanking education offered by various biobanking related bodies and to highlight future needs. The first step is to cover all activities and duties of biobanks: acquiring, collecting, storageing and sharing biological samples and associated data, using adequate assessment for both - materials and data, taking into consideration ethical, legal, and societal issues (ELSI), responding to all stakeholder needs including pharmaceutical and other related industries, patient organisations and many other interested groups, emerging technologies and innovations as well as current and future requirements of health care systems. To compile educational programmes is a comprehensive task for all actors involved in the field of biobanking who contribute to the harmonised process of creating high educational level for future generation of biobankers. The exchange of experience involving extensive international collaboration is the way how to facilitate the process of creating optimal biobanking education. © 2021, European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA).","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Biobank; Biomedical research; COVID-19; Education; Ethical legal and societal issues (ELSI); Future health care; Health policy; Healthcare industry; Innovation; International collaboration; Machine learning; Multidisciplinary; Predictive preventive personalised medicine (PPPM/3PM); Training","artificial intelligence; biobank; biobanking; certification; education program; health care; human; industry; machine learning; medical research; medical society; non profit organization; pandemic; personalized medicine; Review; World Health Organization","","","","","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (871029); Ministerstvo Zdravotnictví Ceské Republiky, MZCR, (00669806, FNPl)","","Hofman P., Brechot C., Zatloukal K., Dagher G., Clement B., Public-private relationships in biobanking: a still underestimated key component of open innovation, Virchows Arch, 464, 1, pp. 3-9, (2014); De Souza Y.G., Greenspan J.S., Biobanking past, present and future: responsibilities and benefits, AIDS, 27, 3, pp. 303-312, (2013); Castellanos- Uribe M., Gormally E., Zhou H., Matzke E., Watson P.H., Biobanking education, Biopreserv Biobank, 18, 1, pp. 1-3, (2020); (2007); OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The Amazon Echo and its intelligent personal assistant, Alexa, is a leading innovation in this area. This novel research examines aspects of privacy relating to personal use of the Echo. It aims to ascertain the types of data that may be vocally extracted from a selection of the multitude of applications that may be linked to the Echo.In the era of IoT, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, privacy concerns are paramount for the individual. Personal data has never been more valuable, both to large reputable corporations and to criminals groups. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) will come into force in May 2018, aiming to protect the personal data of EU citizens. This has further highlighted the emergent risks stemming from this technological medium.This paper demonstrates that a typically configured Echo device can prove to be a vulnerable channel by which personal information may be accessed. Where no safeguards are implemented, a plethora of data including personal identifiable information and personal health information is available from the device. Data exposure by simple vocal request leaves the system vulnerable to inquisition by any unauthorized individual who is within ear shot of the device. The research explores the extent to which these risks can be reduced or mitigated, offering a set of recommendations aimed at preserving user privacy, while still enabling functionality of the device. Adherence to these recommendations will empower individuals to guard against privacy breaches from local sources. © 2018 IEEE.","Amazon Echo; GDPR; Personal Data; Privacy; Voice Command Devices","Data mining; Internet of things; Natural language processing systems; Amazon Echo; GDPR; General data protection regulations; Internet of Things (IOT); Personal assistants; Personal health informations; Personal information; Voice command; Data privacy","","","","","","","Euromicro Conf on Digital System Design, Vienna, pp. 502-509; Lopez G., Quesada L., Guerrero L.A., Alexa Vs.

His work earned him a Nobel Prize in 1906 and initiated the era of mass spectrometry (MS). In the intervening time, other researchers have also been awarded the Nobel Prize for significant advances in MS technology. The development of soft ionization techniques was central to the application of MS to large biological molecules and led to an unprecedented interest in the study of biomolecules such as proteins (proteomics), metabolites (metabolomics), carbohydrates (glycomics), and lipids (lipidomics), allowing a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of health and disease. The interest in large molecules drove improvements in MS resolution and now the challenge is in data deconvolution, intelligent exploitation of heterogeneous data, and interpretation, all of which can be ameliorated with a proposed IMass technology. We define IMass as a combination of MS and artificial intelligence, with each performing a specific role. IMass will offer advantages such as improving speed, sensitivity, and analyses of large data that are presently not possible with MS alone. In this study, we present an overview of the MS considering historical perspectives and applications, challenges, as well as insightful highlights of IMass. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2018.","artificial intelligence;

However, most of today’s medical data lack interoperability: hidden in isolated databases, incompatible systems and proprietary software, the data are difficult to exchange, analyze, and interpret. This slows down medical progress, as technologies that rely on these data – artificial intelligence, big data or mobile applications – cannot be used to their full potential. In this article, we argue that interoperability is a prerequisite for the digital innovations envisioned for future medicine. We focus on four areas where interoperable data and IT systems are particularly important: (1) artificial intelligence and big data; (2) medical communication; (3) research; and (4) international cooperation. We discuss how interoperability can facilitate digital transformation in these areas to improve the health and well-being of patients worldwide. © 2019, The Author(s).","","Artificial intelligence; Big data; International cooperation; Medicine; Big data applications; Data systems; Digital datas; Digital innovations; Incompatible systems; IT system; Medical data; Mobile applications; Proprietary software; System softwares; adult; artificial intelligence; big data; human; international cooperation; mobile application; review; wellbeing; Interoperability","","","","","","","Jensen P.B., Jensen L.J., Brunak S., Mining electronic health records: towards better research applications and clinical care, Nat.

The ageing issue is an aspect that researchers, companies and government should devote efforts in developing smart healthcare innovative technology and applications. In this paper, the topic of disease diagnosis in smart healthcare is reviewed. Typical emerging optimization algorithms and machine learning algorithms are summarized. Evolutionary optimization, stochastic optimization and combinatorial optimization are covered. Owning to the fact that there are plenty of applications in healthcare, four applications in the field of diseases diagnosis (which also list in the top 10 causes of global death in 2015), namely cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, and tuberculosis, are considered. In addition, challenges in the deployment of disease diagnosis in healthcare have been discussed. © 2017 by the authors.","Automation; Computational intelligence; Data analysis; Data mining; Disease diagnosis; Healthcare; Smart city; Smart living; Social progress; Sustainability","algorithm; artificial intelligence; cardiovascular disease; cellular automaton; data mining; detection method; disease; health care; information and communication technology; innovation; machine learning; optimization; smart city; sustainable development; technological change","","","","","Department of Business Administration; School of Information Science & Technology; City University of Hong Kong, CityU; University of Hong Kong, HKU; Donghua University; Universidad de Oviedo; Wuhan University of Technology; Hubei Key Laboratory of Inland Shipping Technology","Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China Virtual Reality Research Center, Effat University, Jeddah 21577, Saudi Arabia; walhalabi@effatUniversity.edu.sa School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China; sallypsh@connect.hku.hk Department of Business Administration and Accountability, Faculty of Economics, The University of Oviedo, 33003 Oviedo, Spain; patriop@uniovi.es Hubei Key Laboratory of Inland Shipping Technology, School of Navigation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430063, China; wenliu@whut.edu.cn School of Information Science & Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai 200051, China; mzhao4@dhu.edu.cn Correspondence: ktchui3-c@my.cityu.edu.hk; Tel.: +852-3442-6718","Kondepudi S.N., Ramanarayanan V., Jain A., Singh G.N., Nitin Agarwal N.K., Kumar R., Singh R., Bergmark P., Hashitani T., Gemma P., Et al., Smart Sustainable Cities: An Analysis of Definitions, (2014); Scheffler R., Cometto G., Tulenko K., Bruckner T., Liu J., Keuffel E.L., Preker A., Stilwell B., Brasileiro J., Campbell J., Health Workforce Requirements for Universal Health Coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals, (2016); Beard J., Ferguson L., Marmot M., Nash P., Phillips D., Staudinge U., Dua T., Saxena S., Ogawa H., Petersen P.E., Et al., World Report on Ageing and Health 2015, (2015); (2017); Du G., Sun C., Location planning problem of service centers for sustainable home healthcare: Evidence from the empirical analysis of Shanghai, Sustainability, 7, pp. 15812-15832, (2015); Castro M.D.F., Mateus R., Serodio F., Braganca L., Development of benchmarks for operating costs and resources consumption to be used in healthcare building sustainability assessment methods, Sustainability, 7, pp. 13222-13248, (2015); Momete D.C., Building a sustainable healthcare model: A cross-country analysis, Sustainability, 8, (2016); Friedman G.J., Selective Feedback Computers for Engineering Synthesis and Nervous System Analogy, (1956); Friedberg R.M., A Learning Machine: Part I, IBM J.

Information technology even changed on how hospital order stocks activities. E-health system is a stage that uses the ICT to interface different clients; it was intended to convey social insurance. Mobile health information system and internet support public health and clinical care-offers and also it is widely available and can enhancing electronic health for healthcare organization at different level; such as regional, community, and individual levels. Telematics has ease people from afar to do medical check via media usually. One part of e-Health is electronic medical record that contains patients information and accessible by healthcare staff. Clinical decision support system is a system that helps to make a decision regarding their patients matter. Management and maintenance of server should also be watch after as it affects many things in the information technology. Administrative staff also record their patients clinical record and organizing their financial management by using IT. Even robots have replaced some of the position such as doing surgery in health organizations. This study is an attempt to provide a picture of preferences over the information and communication emerging technology to enabling healthcare innovation through big data perspective. The results are interesting. Healthcare innovation through ICT and big data are indispensable elements of a multifaceted approach to forestall medication errors and enhance the patient safety. Clinical staff play a major role in the health organizations as information system in health organization. Improvisation of uniformity and recognition of the design aside from implementation of such systems should also be advantageous to the ICT though big data. Likewise, generating an economic and policy environment conducive to the financial intention of hospitals and physicians will facilitate wider adoption of such technology in the health information system sector. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Clinical decision support system; Health information technology; Mobile health","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Decision support systems; Health insurance; Human resource management; Information use; Medical computing; Medical information systems; mHealth; Telematics; Clinical decision support systems; E health; Emerging technologies; Health information systems; Health information technology; Health informations; Health organizations; Health systems; Information and communication; Information and Communication Technologies; Hospitals","","","","","","","Stair R., Reynolds G., Principles of information systems, Cengage Learning, (2013); Murray-Weir M., Magid S., Robbins L., Quinlan P., Sanchez-Villagomez P., Shaha S., A computerized order entry system was adopted with high user satisfaction at an orthopedic teaching hospital, HSS J, 10, 1, pp. 52-58, (2014); Herrick D.M., Gorman L., Goodman J.C., Health Information Technology: Benefits and Problems.

The technique has recorded a number of achievements for unearthing meaningful features and accomplishing tasks that were hitherto difficult to solve by other methods and human experts. Currently, biological and medical devices, treatment, and applications are capable of generating large volumes of data in the form of images, sounds, text, graphs, and signals creating the concept of big data. The innovation of DL is a developing trend in the wake of big data for data representation and analysis. DL is a type of machine learning algorithm that has deeper (or more) hidden layers of similar function cascaded into the network and has the capability to make meaning from medical big data. Current transformation drivers to achieve personalized health care delivery will be possible with the use of mobile health (mHealth). DL can provide the analysis for the deluge of data generated from mHealth apps. This paper reviews the fundamentals of DL methods and presents a general view of the trends in DL by capturing literature from PubMed and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers database publications that implement different variants of DL. We highlight the implementation of DL in health care, which we categorize into biological system, electronic health record, medical image, and physiological signals. In addition, we discuss some inherent challenges of DL affecting biomedical and health domain, as well as prospective research directions that focus on improving health management by promoting the application of physiological signals and modern internet technology. ©Igbe Tobore, Jingzhen Li, Liu Yuhang, Yousef Al-Handarish, Abhishek Kandwal, Zedong Nie, Lei Wang.","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Biologicals; Biomedical; Deep learning; ECG; EEG; Electronic health record; Machine learning; Medical imaging; MHealth","Algorithms; Biomedical Engineering; Deep Learning; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Nerve Net; algorithm; biomedical engineering; health care delivery; human; nerve cell network; physiology; procedures","","","","","The World Academy of Sciences, TWAS; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61871375, U1505251, U1713219); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2018YFC2001002); Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program, (JCYJ20180507182231907)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC) under grant number 61871375, U1505251 and U1713219.

Space science, technology and its applications can provide a wide range of solutions to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and thus contribute to achieving economic, social and environmental sustainable development. This paper addresses the contributions of space activities from three different perspectives: policy, strategy and technology. It focuses on a subset of challenges linked to the Sustainable Development Goals, namely global health, water, energy and urban development. The proposed strategy perspective considers elements, such as interdisciplinarity, spin-in and spin-off transfers, open innovation processes, and sustainability at large. Space exploration programmes are usually conceived around space mission requirements and technologies with a maturity level which allows for their implementation into planned technology roadmaps. Therefore, it is discussed how such roadmaps could better integrate policy and strategic aspects linked to sustainability on Earth. What if a system is efficiently designed to operate in space and at the same time allows for sustainable development on Earth? The further integration of key enabling technologies (big data, artificial intelligence systems, advanced robotics) are opening a new era in the exploration of other planets where autonomy is an essential requirement. At the same time such developments can become an integral part of the future developments on Earth, providing smart solutions to the citizens of tomorrow and opening up new business sectors associated to these spin-offs. For example, the development of Additive Layer Manufacturing technology will simplify the production of mechanical components and their logistic chain. However, it will also open up new ways of thinking on a large scale, for instance in the construction of buildings and structures using local materials, such as Moon regolith or Earth sand. Other examples are In-Situ Resource Utilisation and viewing a building or a city as a spaceship system, which will not only allow space habitats to include self-regenerative functions, but also allow smart cities on Earth to become greener and more sustainable, especially in view of the expansion of population, the resulting densification and increase of urban areas. The aim of the strategy proposed in this paper is to approach sustainability for development from a holistic perspective looking not only at a product of space technology and how one could transfer this into a terrestrial application but also at strategies for achieving spin-offs in compliance with the most urging topics of this century.

The leading countries in this global value chain (GVC) present a holistic perception of this indissoluble binomial. However, there are learner countries which have been integrated in an unprecedented way into Aeronautics. Therefore, this paradigm break is the reason why this investigation was conducted. The “technological capability” concept builds an architecture that fully supports the relation between technological and governance development in Politics, Commerce and Society. Therefore, on this research, a theoretical approach of Science and Technology in the field of Social Sciences and International Relations was developed with the purpose of generating an adequate analysis framework based on the Governance Theory, Open Innovation and Technological Capabilities literature. This framework served to analyze three case studies, such as Brazil, Canada and China. As intermediate industrial leaders in the manufacture of regional aircraft, despite having a different technological trajectory, their technical capabilities impacted on the GVC, thus generating a new governance in local institutions and international organizations. In these three cases, not only favorable conditions have emerged, but also, they faced a poor management regarding public policies. As a result, it was found that this atmosphere is called as a National Innovation System (NIS) and it is a methodological turning point to analyze the technological transfer, adoption and assimilation in developing countries, which could lead to finished products for the space sector. In the three case studies, the main interest was a military, political and industrial integration. However, considering the Industry 4.0 and a global technological convergence, it is concluded that the aerospace industry has become a multicausal and multisectoral phenomenon when integrating new advanced functionalities such as Blockchain, Big Data, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Analytics. This technological enablement has led to industry good practices in Aeronautics regarding discrete manufacturing and B2B2C services; as for the space sector concerning Remote Sensing for disaster management, public health, communications and climate change studies. All the previous based on an open innovation economy, which is nourished not only by an inter-business dynamic, but also by external data sources. Now the challenges of this reformulation will revolve around integration, global standards, systems interoperability and data security (GDPR).

Space science, technology and its applications can provide a wide range of solutions to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and thus contribute to achieving economic, social and environmental sustainable development. This paper addresses the contributions of space activities from three different perspectives: policy, strategy and technology. It focuses on a sub-set of challenges linked to the Sustainable Development Goals, namely global health, water, energy and urban development. The proposed strategy perspective considers elements, such as interdisciplinarity, spin-in and spin-off transfers, open innovation processes, and sustainability at large. Space exploration programmes are usually conceived around space mission requirements and technologies with a maturity level that allows for their implementation into planned technology roadmaps. Therefore, it is discussed how such roadmaps could better integrate policy and strategic aspects linked to sustainability on Earth. What if a system is efficiently designed to operate in space and at the same time allows for sustainable development on Earth? The further integration of key enabling technologies (big data, artificial intelligence systems, advanced robotics) are opening a new era in the exploration of other planets where autonomy is an essential requirement. At the same time such developments can become an integral part of the future developments on Earth, providing smart solutions to the citizens of tomorrow and opening up new business sectors associated to these spin-offs. For example, the development of Additive Layer Manufacturing technology will simplify the production of mechanical components and their logistic chain. However, it will also open up new ways of thinking on a large scale, for instance in the construction of buildings and structures using local materials, such as Moon regolith or Earth sand. Other examples are In Situ Resource Utilisation and viewing a building or a city as a spaceship system, which will not only allow space habitats to include self-regenerative functions, but also allow smart cities on Earth to become greener and more sustainable, especially in view of the expansion of population, the resulting densification and increase of urban areas. The aim of the strategy proposed in this paper is to approach sustainability for development from a holistic perspective looking not only at a product of space technology and how one could transfer this into a terrestrial application but also at strategies for achieving spin-offs in compliance with the most urging topics of this century. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agenda 2030; Future space technology; Sustainability","","","","","","United Nations Office at Vienna; United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs of the Secretariat","The Committee is supported by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs of the Secretariat (UNOOSA), located at the United Nations Office at Vienna.

The ushering of the Medicine 4.0 has resulted in an increased effort to develop platforms, both at the hardware level as well as the underlying software level. This vision has led to the development of Healthcare IoT (H-IoT) systems. The basic enabling technologies include the communication systems between the sensing nodes and the processors; and the processing algorithms for generating an output from the data collected by the sensors. However, at present, these enabling technologies are also supported by several new technologies. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed the H-IoT systems at almost every level. The fog/edge paradigm is bringing the computing power close to the deployed network and hence mitigating many challenges in the process. While the big data allows handling an enormous amount of data. Additionally, the Software Defined Networks (SDNs) bring flexibility to the system while the blockchains are finding the most novel use cases in H-IoT systems. The Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) and Tactile Internet (TI) are driving the innovation in the H-IoT applications. This paper delves into the ways these technologies are transforming the H-IoT systems and also identifies the future course for improving the Quality of Service (QoS) using these new technologies. © 1998-2012 IEEE.","blockchain; edge computing; fog computing; H-IoT; machine learning; software defined networks; WBAN","Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Health care; Quality of service; Computing power; Emerging technologies; Enabling technologies; Healthcare industry; Internet of thing (IOT); IOT applications; Processing algorithms; Sensing nodes; Internet of things","","","","","Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation, (IITP-2019-2016-0-00313); Ministry of Education, MOE, (2018R1D1A1A09082266); Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (22A20130012814)","Manuscript received June 5, 2019; revised November 13, 2019 and January 9, 2020; accepted February 6, 2020.

IoT is the infrastructure, Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are the basis of components and “Things” - may they be visible or integrated into every day devices. Comfort, health, services of all kinds, safety, security and privacy of people depend increasingly on these. The challenges have been e.g. taken up by AIOTI, the Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation, or ARTEMIS, EPoSS and AENEAS, the three industrial associations in the ECSEL Joint Undertaking, with an industry-oriented European Research Program, and many national programs, e.g. by BMVIT (Austrian Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology). Highly automated or autonomous smart interacting systems are becoming the main drivers for innovations and efficient services. The impact on society and economy is tremendous and will change our way of living and economy in a disruptive manner, and we will face not only benefits but also new hazards and risks. Dependability (safety, reliability, availability, security, maintainability, resilience, etc.) in a holistic sense becomes an important issue. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data and open, adaptive systems in a rather unpredictable environment are key challenges for systems of systems. The paper will try to provide an overview not primarily on technological but also on some economic, societal and ethical aspects of highly automated and autonomous system in a changing world, hopefully better than the “Brave New World” of Aldous Huxley or “1984”. © 2018 Gerhard Chroust, Linz, Österreich.","Autonomous Systems; Cyber-physical Systems; Embedded Intelligence; Ethical aspects; Internet of Things (IoT); Legal aspects; Liability; Safety; Security; Smart Systems; Societal impact; Systems-of-Systems","Accident prevention; Artificial intelligence; Big data; Cyber Physical System; Industrial research; Information management; Internet of things; Learning systems; Philosophical aspects; Product liability; System of systems; Systems engineering; Autonomous systems; Embedded intelligence; Ethical aspects; Internet of Things (IOT); Legal aspects; Security; Smart System; Societal impacts; Systems of systems; Embedded systems","","","","","AQUAS, (737459-2, Productive4.0); EC ECSEL; ENABLE-S3; EU ARTEMIS/ECSEL; Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology, (692480, SemI40); IoSENSE, (692455-2); SECREDAS, (783163, 783221); Division of Administrative Services, DAS, (783119); Analog Devices; Institute for National Security Ethics and Leadership, INSEL, (692474); Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, (692466); European Commission, EC, (645149); Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering, AINSE; Baoji University of Arts And Sciences, BUAS, (737475-2); Clough; AutoCRC, (737469-2); Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie, BMVIT; Engineering Advancement Association of Japan, ENAA; Product Board Animal Feed, PDV","Funding text 1: Part of the work received funding from the EC under grant agreement n° 645149 (CP-SETIS), from the EU ARTEMIS/ECSEL Joint Undertaking under grant agreement n° 692474 (AMASS), and from both, the EC ECSEL JU and the partners’ national funding authorities (in Austria FFG (Austrian Research Promotion Agency) on behalf of BMVIT, The Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology) - (Grant agreements n° 692466 (SemI40), n° 692480 (IoSENSE), n° 692455-2 (ENABLE-S3), n° 737475-2 (AQUAS), n° 737459-2 (Productive4.0) and n° 737469-2 (AutoDrive) and recently started projects SECREDAS (783119), iDev40 (783163) and AfarCloud (783221)).; Funding text 2: Part of the work received funding from the EC under grant agreement n° 645149 (CP-SETIS), from the EU ARTEMIS/ECSEL Joint Undertaking under grant agreement n° 692474 (AMASS), and from both, the EC ECSEL JU and the partners' national funding authorities (in Austria FFG (Austrian Research Promotion Agency) on behalf of BMVIT, The Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology) - (Grant agreements n° 692466 (SemI40), n° 692480 (IoSENSE), n° 692455-2 (ENABLE-S3), n° 737475-2 (AQUAS), n° 737459-2 (Productive4.0) and n° 737469-2 (AutoDrive) and recently started projects SECREDAS (783119), iDev40 (783163) and AfarCloud (783221)).","Primack B.A., Shensa A., Social media use and perceived social isolation among young adults in the U.S, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 4, (2017); Delsing J., IoT Automation - ARROWHEAD Framework, (2017); Risk V., Data Breach Digest Scenario, (2017); Greenberg A., How An Entire Nation Became Russia'S Test Lab for Cyberwar, (2017); White Paper on The Future of Europe, (2017); Heindl P., Damm W., SafeTRANS Working Group “Highly automated Systems: Test, safety, and development processes”, Recommendations on Actions and Research Challenges, (2016); Austrian Industry, Research and Academia: Austrian Research, Development & Innovation Roadmap for Automated Vehicles, (2016); EPoSS Strategic Research Agenda of The European Technology Platform on Smart Systems Integration, (2017); ARTEMIS Strategic Research Agenda, (2016); Schoitsch E., Niehaus J., Strategic agenda on standardization for cyber-physical systems, CP-SETIS (EC Horizon 2020 Project N° 645149), (2017); SmartM2M: IoT Standards Landscape and Future Evolutions, (2016); SmartM2M - IoT LSP Use Cases and Standards Gaps, (2016); Action Plan for Future Mobility in Europe (Horizon 2020 Coordination and Support Action 2016-2018); Amendment to Article 8, §5 and to Article 39, §1, to The Vienna Convention 1968 and The Global Technical Regulations for Wheeled Vehicles, (1998); Digitising European Industry - Two Years After The Launch of The Initiative, (2018); Digitising European Industry - Digital Industrial Platforms, (2017); Schoitsch E., Smart Systems Everywhere - How much Smartness is tolerable?, IDIMT 2017, Proceedings, pp. 361-373, (2017)","E.

Using Big Data solutions for the healthcare system as it is both an opportunity to improve the quality of medical performance and cost optimization. In this paper we aimed to analyse the impact of applying innovative technologies based on Big Data in diabetes management. The purpose of the study was to determine patients' perception on adoption of innovative technologies for the prevention, detection and treatment of diabetes as well as their involvement in establishing own treatment plans. The data we collected through a questionnaire, and we processed them with SPSS v.24. According to the results obtained, we found that patients are open to upgrading treatment and sharing of new treatments. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the need to shift from traditional medical system at mHealth system - the premise of applying innovative technologies based on Big Data, cloud computing and smart mobile devices. Through integration and interoperability of such disparate information, the decision support system and knowledge management system will have a digital archive and mechanisms that will allow the addition of a new dimension in the treatment of the disease by prevention and personalized treatment.","Big Data; Diabetes; Innovative technologies; TIC","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Decision support systems; Distributed computer systems; Economics; Health care; Innovation; Interoperability; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Medical problems; mHealth; Patient treatment; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Cost optimization; Diabetes management; Digital archives; Health-care system; Healthcare sectors; Information and communications technology; Innovative technology; Knowledge management system; Information management","","","","","","","Andreu-Perez J., Poon C.C., Merrifield R.D., Wong S.T., Yang G.Z., Big data for health, IEEE J Biomed Health Inform, 19, 4, pp. 1193-1208, (2015); Chesbrough H., Vanhaverbeke W., West J., New Frontiers in Open Innovation, (2014); Daniel B., Big Data and analytics in higher education: Opportunities and challenges, British Journal of Educational Technology, 46, 5, pp. 904-920, (2015); De Mauro A., Greco M., Grimaldi M., A formal definition of big data based on its essential features, Lib Review, 65, 3, pp. 122-135, (2016); DeRouen T., Promises and pitfalls in the use of ""big data"" for clinical research, J Dent Res, 94, 9, pp. 107S-109S, (2015); Franke B., Plante J.F., Et al., Statistical inference, learning and models in big data, International Statistical Review, 84, 3, pp. 371-389, (2016); Fuller M., Big data: New science, new challenges, new dialogical opportunities, Journal of Religion & Science, 50, 3, pp. 569-582, (2015); Gandomi A., Haider M., Beyond the hype: Big data concepts, methods, and analytics, International Journal of Information Management, 35, pp. 137-144, (2015); Gendron M.S., Business Intelligence and the Cloud, (2014); Gilmore R.O., From big data to deep insight in developmental science, Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science, 7, 2, pp. 112-126, (2016); Hiller J.S., Healthy predictions?

This increase in disease burden has been accompanied by pervasive health disparities associated with low disease detection rates, inadequate awareness, poor use of evidence-based interventions, and low adherence rates among patients in rural regions in India and those with low socioeconomic status. Several research groups in India have developed innovative technologies and care-delivery models for screening, diagnosis, clinical management, remote-monitoring, self-management, and rehabilitation for a range of chronic conditions. These innovations can leverage advances in sensor technology, genomic tools, artificial intelligence, big-data analytics, and so on, for improving access to and delivering quality and affordable personalized medicine in primary care. In addition, several health technology start-ups are entering this booming market that is set to grow rapidly. Innovations outside biomedical space (eg, protection of traditional wisdom in diet, lifestyle, yoga) are equally important and are part of a comprehensive solution. Such low-cost, culturally tailored, robust innovations to promote health and reduce disparities require partnership among multi-sectors including academia, industry, civil society, and health systems operating in a conducive policy environment that fosters adequate public and private investments. In this article, we present the unique opportunity for India to use culturally tailored, low-cost, high-impact technological innovations and strategies to ameliorate the perennial challenges of social, policy, and environmental challenges including poverty, low educational attainment, culture, and other socioeconomic factors to promote cardiovascular health and advance health equity. © 2019 Ethnicity and Disease, Inc..

Existing literatures have analyzed and discussed implemented digital health innovations from the perspective of technologies, whereas how policy mechanisms contributed to the formulation of the digital health landscape for COVID-19 was overlooked. This study aimed to examine the contexts and key mechanisms in China's rapid mobilization of digital health interventions in response to COVID-19, and to document and share lessons learned. Methods: Policy documents were identified and retrieved from government portals and recognized media outlets. Data on digital health interventions were collected through three consecutive surveys administered between 23 January 2020 and 31 March 2020 by China Academy of Information and Communication Technology (CAICT) affiliated to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Participants were member companies of the Internet Health alliance established by MIIT and the National Health Commission (NHC) in June 2016. Self-report digital interventions focusing on social and economic recovery were excluded. Two hundred and sixty-six unique digital health interventions meeting our criteria were extracted from 175 narratives on digital health interventions submitted by 116 participating companies. Thematic analysis was conducted to describe the scope and priority of policies advocating for the use of digital health technologies and the implementation pattern of digital health interventions. Data limitations precluded an evaluation of the impact of digital health interventions over a longer time frame. Results: Between January and March 2020, national policy directives promoting the use of digital technologies for the containment of COVID-19 collectively advocated for use cases in emergency planning and preparedness, public health response, and clinical services. Interventions to strengthen clinical services were mentioned more than the other two themes (n = 15, 62.5% (15/24)). Using digital technologies for public health response was mentioned much less than clinical services (n = 5, 20.8% (5/24)). Emergency planning and preparedness was least mentioned (n = 4, 16.7% (4/24)). Interventions in support of clinical services disproportionately favored healthcare facilities in less resource-constraint settings. Digital health interventions shared the same pattern of distribution. More digital health technologies were implemented in clinical services (n = 103, 38.7% (103/266)) than that in public health response (n = 91, 34.2% (91/266)). Emergency planning and preparedness had the least self-reported digital health interventions (n = 72, 27.1% (72/266)). We further identified case studies under each theme in which the wide use of digital health technologies highlighted contextual factors and key enabling mechanisms. Conclusions: The contextual factors and key enabling mechanisms through the use of policy instruments to promote digital health interventions for COVID-19 in China include pathway of policy directives influencing the private sector using a decentralized system, the booming digital health landscape before COVID-19, agility of the public sector in introducing regulatory flexibilities and incentives to mobilize the private sector. © 2021","Artificial intelligence;

Through one of the world’s largest deployments to date of the open-source District Health Information Software 2 (DHIS2), the country now has a national public sector health data warehouse. Information from previously fragmented data systems is now unified in a common data repository, enabling data exchange for health information systems and decision-making. Work is ongoing to create lifetime electronic health records for all citizens that can be transferred between health facilities. Extensive customization of open-source software has laid the foundations for a national digital networking system. Initiatives have focused on producing digital solutions to aid priorities such as strengthening the health system as a whole as well as supporting specific technical interventions, for example improving the civil registration and vital statistics system. Digital solutions have also supported the Bangladesh health workforce strategy through a set of registries that electronically captures and maintains human resource information for the entire public health sector, including monitoring staff attendance through the use of low-cost biometric fingerprint time-attendance machines. Citizens are encouraged to engage in shaping health services via a web-based complaints and suggestions system, and a new system to raise health awareness via public digital displays has started in Dhaka. Strong support at the highest political level has been critical to the success of efforts to introduce these innovations. The endeavour has also generated a cadre of enthusiastic eHealth proponents, who are focused on further strengthening and expanding the existing systems and on harnessing the vast amount of information amassed at the central data repository through big data analysis, artificial intelligence and machine learning.","Bangladesh; DHIS2; digital health; eHealth; electronic health records","Bangladesh; Data Warehousing; Delivery of Health Care; Health Information Systems; Humans; Inventions; Public Health; Telemedicine; Bangladesh; data warehouse; health care delivery; human; invention; medical information system; organization and management; public health; telemedicine","","","","","","","","","","NLM (Medline)","","","","","","23045272","","","31441440","English","WHO South East Asia J Public Health","Editorial","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071495905"

From a futurist perspective, however, this dichotomy of diabetes care represents an opportunity for digital healthcare. The focus of technological innovation is unlikely to be the replacement of the multidisciplinary diabetes team but rather the provision of meaningful individual and family support between clinic visits and, on a larger scale, the facilitation of population health management for diabetes. We can also expect to see new therapies, including implantable drug delivery systems, automated closed-loop systems and miniaturized non-invasive glucose monitoring systems. New digital health technologies will create a ‘digital diabetes ecosystem’ to enhance rather than devolve care from humans. Concerns related to data privacy and ownership will inevitably rise, thus a future for diabetes care relying heavily on technology is not inevitably utopian. Nevertheless, revolutions in the development of novel sensors, accumulation of ‘big data’, and use of artificial intelligence will provide exciting opportunities for preventing, monitoring and treating diabetes in the near future. © 2018 Diabetes UK","","Artificial Intelligence; Biomedical Technology; Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring; Diabetes Mellitus; Forecasting; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Inventions; Machine Learning; glycosylated hemoglobin; artificial intelligence; blood glucose monitoring; diabetes mellitus; drug delivery system; ecosystem; human; machine learning; mobile application; organization and management; population health; Review; virtual reality; blood; devices; diabetes mellitus; forecasting; invention; medical technology; metabolism; trends","","glycosylated hemoglobin, 9062-63-9; Glycated Hemoglobin A, ","","","","","2.4bn smartphone users in 2017, (2017); (2016); Shatz D., 2016 Presidential Address: Diabetes at 212°—Confronting the Invisible Disease, Diabetes Care, 39, pp. 1657-1663, (2016); California Medical Association Foundation, Diabetes Care Coordination – A Team Based Guide, (2012); Diabetes UK: 15 healthcare essentials - the care you should expect; Koopman R.J., Kochendorfer K.M., Moore J.L., Mehr D.R., Wakefield D.S., Yadamsuren B., Et al., A diabetes dashboard and physician efficiency and accuracy in accessing data needed for high-quality diabetes care, Ann Fam Med, 9, pp. 398-405, (2011); Chung S., Panattoni L., Chi J., Palaniappan L., Can Secure Patient-Provider Messaging Improve Diabetes Care?, Diabetes Care, pii, (2017); Zikmund-Fisher B.J., Exe N.L., Witteman H.O., Numeracy and literacy independently predict patients' ability to identify out-of-range test results, J Med Internet Res, 16, (2014); Vigersky R.A., Escaping the Hemoglobin A1c-Centric World in Evaluating Diabetes Mellitus Interventions, J Diabetes Sci Technol., 9, pp. 1148-1151, (2015); #WeAreNotWaiting to make the world a better place; NIGHTSCOUT: We are not waiting; Diabettech – Diabetes and Technology; The value of customer experience, quantified; Klonoff D.C., Kerr D., Wong J.C., Pavlovic Y., Koliwad S., Hu J., Et al., Digital Diabetes Congress 2017, J Diabetes Sci Technol., 11, pp. 1045-1052, (2017); Klonoff D.C., Smart sensors for maintaining physiologic homeostasis, J Diabetes Sci Technol, 5, pp. 470-475, (2011); Kropff J., Choudhary P., Neupane S., Barnard K., Bain S.C., Kapitza C., Et al., Accuracy and Longevity of an Implantable Continuous Glucose Sensor in the PRECISE Study: A 180-Day, Prospective, Multicenter, Pivotal Trial.

What China is doing now, what it has achieved, and what remains to be done should be of interest to health policy-makers, worldwide. We identify the challenges posed by China’s two principal strategies to tackle diabetes: (1) A short-term pilot strategy of health promotion, detection and control of chronic diseases in 265 national demonstration areas (NDAs); and (2) A long-term strategy to extend health promotion and strengthen primary care capacity and health system integration throughout China. Finally, we consider how Chinese innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) and Big Data may contribute to improving diagnosis, controlling complications and increasing access to care. Health system integration in China will require overcoming the fragmentation of a system that still places excessive reliance on local government financing. Moreover, what remains to be done resembles deeper challenges faced by healthcare systems worldwide: the need to upgrade primary care and reduce inequalities in access to health services. © 2020 The Author(s).","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; China; Diabetes; Health Policy","Artificial Intelligence; China; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Financing, Government; Health Care Reform; Healthy People Programs; Humans; Insurance, Health; Male; Primary Health Care; artificial intelligence; China; female; financial management; health care policy; health insurance; health promotion; human; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; organization and management; primary health care","","","","","Peking University, PKU","We thank Manuel Raices Perez-Castañeda for his invitation to present a preliminary version of this paper to the International Diabetes Congress (IDC) in Varadero, Cuba in December, 2018.

Digital health and AI applications in medicine and biology are emerging worldwide, not only in resource-rich but also resource-limited regions. AI predates to the mid-20th century, but the current wave of AI builds in part on machine learning (ML), big data, and algorithms that can learn from massive amounts of online user data from patients or healthy persons. There are lessons to be learned from AI applications in different medical specialties and across developed and resource-limited contexts. A case in point is congenital heart defects (CHDs) that continue to plague sub-Saharan Africa, which calls for innovative approaches to improve risk prediction and performance of the available diagnostics. Beyond CHDs, AI in cardiology is a promising context as well. The current suite of digital health applications in CHD and cardiology include complementary technologies such as neural networks, ML, natural language processing and deep learning, not to mention embedded digital sensors. Algorithms that build on these advances are beginning to complement traditional medical expertise while inviting us to redefine the concepts and definitions of expertise in molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. We examine and share here the lessons learned in current attempts to implement AI and digital health in CHD for precision risk prediction and diagnosis in resource-limited settings. These top 10 lessons on AI and digital health summarized in this expert review are relevant broadly beyond CHD in cardiology and medical innovations. As with AI itself that calls for systems approaches to data capture, analysis, and interpretation, both developed and developing countries can usefully learn from their respective experiences as digital health continues to evolve worldwide. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Congenital heart defects; Deep learning; Digital health; EHealth; Machine learning","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Cardiology; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Precision Medicine; Africa south of the Sahara; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; bioinformatics; cardiac imaging; congenital heart malformation; deep learning; developing country; disease classification; genomics; health care policy; human; machine learning; molecular fingerprinting; natural language processing; personalized medicine; priority journal; proteomics; signal detection; telecardiology; telehealth; algorithm; artificial intelligence; cardiology; congenital heart malformation; procedures","","","","","DELGEME; Faculty of Health Sciences; Harry Crossley Foundation, (107740/Z/15/Z); University of Cape Town, UCT","N.E.T. is supported by the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town through the Harry Crossley Foundation.

This new approach has been generated by the tendencies of recent decades regarding the continuous increase of chronic medical conditions associated with both the modern lifestyle and the accelerated rate of population ageing. Therefore, under the pressure of the three requirements that shape the future of care services (better quality care, improving patient experience and health, while reducing total costs), we are moving towards a new ecosystem-based model of care that incorporates the following key features: permanent innovation, self and continuous care based on emergent technologies (Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, Big data etc.) available nearby or at home, patient engagement, personalised assistance, data and analytics. In this regard, as part of the European research effort, in this paper it is presented a new integrated and validated framework using IoT to provide non-intrusive monitoring and personalised assistance services to older adults: the vINCI platform.

This may fundamentally change the way we live, work, and relate to one another. Embracing data and digital information is a top priority for most industries these days, and Life Sciences is no exception. The pharmaceutical industry in particular is fundamentally a data-driven business. Inspired by a desire to “Go Big on Data,” we developed a strategic roadmap defining a digital transformation to reimagine the way we work in Novartis Global Drug Development, leveraging data science to generate and inject actionable insights into our best practices. We launched a program called Nerve Live, and built a state-of-the-art data and analytics platform to harness past and present operational data, providing access to decades of drug development “experience” buried across multiple sources. The platform enabled the systematic application of machine learning and predictive analytics to generate “intelligence”: new insights across multiple functional areas. To action the insights and create “value,” we crafted skillfully designed end-user applications for domain experts to plan, track, predict, compare and monitor domain activities, optimize costs, and maximize quality. Today, the Nerve Live program enables insights-driven decision making at scale, unlocking productivity, and providing transparency across the Novartis Global Drug Development organization and beyond. We identified three main drivers making the Nerve Live program successful and enabling the associated digital transformation to flourish. We discuss the challenges, highlight the benefits, and see the importance of leading the way to become future proof. © 2020 The Authors.

The “Health Care Internet of Things”, which uses sensors, apps, and remote monitoring could provide continuous clinical information in the cloud that enables clinicians to access the information they need to care for patients everywhere. Greater standardization of acquisition protocols will be needed to maximize the potential gains from automation and machine learning. Recent findings: Recent artificial intelligence applications on cardiac imaging will not be diagnosing patients and replacing doctors but will be augmenting their ability to find key relevant data they need to care for a patient and present it in a concise, easily digestible format. Summary: Risk stratification will transition from oversimplified population-based risk scores to machine learning-based metrics incorporating a large number of patient-specific clinical and imaging variables in real-time beyond the limits of human cognition. This will deliver highly accurate and individual personalized risk assessments and facilitate tailored management plans. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Big Data; Cardiac imaging; Decision support system; Electronic health record; Personalized medicine","Artificial Intelligence; Cardiac Imaging Techniques; Delivery of Health Care; Diffusion of Innovation; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Precision Medicine; access to information; artificial intelligence; automation; cardiac imaging; clinical decision support system; clinical protocol; critically ill patient; echocardiography; electronic health record; human; imaging; machine learning; medical record; remote sensing; Review; risk assessment; standardization; artificial intelligence; health care delivery; mass communication; personalized medicine; procedures; trends","","","","","","","Fornell D., How artificial intelligence will change medical imaging, Accessed February, (2017); Abdolrasulnia M., Menachemi N., Shewchuk R.M., Ginter P.M., Duncan W.J., Brooks R.G., Market effects on electronic health record adoption by physicians, Health Care Managt Rev., 33, (2008); Dilsizian S.E., Siegel E.L., Artificial Intelligence in medicine and cardiac imaging: harnessing Big Data and advanced computing to provide personalized medical diagnosis and treatment, Curr Cardiol Rep, 16, (2014); Kitakaze M., Et al., Trends in characteristics of CVD in Asia and Japan.

The high potential of human-to-human transmission led to subsequent COVID-19 global pandemic. Public health strategies including reduced social contact and lockdown have been adopted in many countries. Nonetheless, social distancing and isolation could also represent risk factors for mental disorders, resulting in loneliness, reduced social support and under-detection of mental health needs. Along with this, social distancing determines a relevant obstacle for direct access to psychiatric care services. The pandemic generates the urgent need for integrating technology into innovative models of mental healthcare. Aims: In this paper, we discuss the potential role of telepsychiatry (TP) and other cutting-edge technologies in the management of mental health assistance. We narratively review the literature to examine the advantages and risks related to the extensive application of these new therapeutic settings, along with the possible limitations and ethical concerns. Results: Telemental health services may be particularly feasible and appropriate for the support of patients, family members and healthcare providers during this COVID-19 pandemic. The integration of TP with other technological innovations (eg, mobile apps, virtual reality, big data and artificial intelligence (AI)) opens up interesting future perspectives for the improvement of mental health assistance. Conclusion: Telepsychiatry is a promising and growing way to deliver mental health services but is still underused. The COVID-19 pandemic may serve as an opportunity to introduce and promote, among numerous mental health professionals, the knowledge of the possibilities offered by the digital era. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","Artificial Intelligence; COVID-19; Delivery of Health Care; Family; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Mobile Applications; Privacy; Psychiatry; Psychotherapy; SARS-CoV-2; Telemedicine; Virtual Reality; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; evidence based medicine; feasibility study; human; legal aspect; mental health care; mental health service; pandemic; priority journal; privacy; psychotherapy; telepsychiatry; artificial intelligence; ethics; family; health care delivery; health care personnel; mental disease; mobile application; procedures; psychiatry; psychology; telemedicine; virology; virtual reality","","","","","","","Mazza C., Ricci E., Biondi S., Et al., A nationwide survey of psychological distress among italian people during the covid-19 pandemic: immediate psychological responses and associated factors, Int J Environ Res Public Health, 17, pp. 1-14, (2020); Ni M.Y., Yang L., Leung C.M.C., Et al., Mental health, risk factors, and social media use during the COVID-19 epidemic and Cordon Sanitaire among the community and health professionals in Wuhan, China: cross-sectional survey, JMIR Ment Heal, 7, (2020); Gonzalez-Sanguino C., Ausin B., Castellanos M.A., Et al., Mental health consequences during the initial stage of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in Spain, Brain Behav Immun, 87, pp. 172-176, (2020); Ahmed M.Z., Ahmed O., Aibao Z., Et al., Epidemic of COVID-19 in China and associated psychological problems, Asian J Psychiatr, 51, (2020); Yao H., Chen J.H., Xu Y.F., Patients with mental health disorders in the COVID-19 epidemic, Lancet Psychiatry, 7, (2020); Kiraly O., Potenza M.N., Stein D.J., Et al., Preventing problematic internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic: consensus guidance, Compr Psychiatry, 100, (2020); Pettorruso M., Valle S., Cavic E., Et al., Problematic Internet use (PIU), personality profiles and emotion dysregulation in a cohort of young adults: trajectories from risky behaviors to addiction, Psychiatry Res, 289, (2020); Li R., Pei S., Chen B., Et al., Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), Science, 368, pp. 489-493, (2020); Zhou J., Liu L., Xue P., Et al., Mental health response to the COVID-19 outbreak in China, Am J Psychiatry, 177, pp. 574-575, (2020); Kola L., Global mental health and COVID-19, Lancet Psychiatry, 366, pp. 19-20, (2020); A health telematics policy in support of WHO’s Health-For-All strategy for global health development: report of the WHO group consultation on health telematics, (1997); Yellowlees P., Nafiz N., The psychiatrist-patient relationship of the future: anytime, anywhere?, Harv Rev Psychiatry, 18, pp. 96-102, (2010); Corruble E., A viewpoint from Paris on the COVID-19 pandemic: a necessary turn to telepsychiatry, J Clin Psychiatry, 81, (2020); Hilt R.J., Telemedicine for child collaborative or integrated care, Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am, 26, pp. 637-645, (2017); Richardson L.K., Frueh B.C., Grubaugh A.L., Et al., Current directions in videoconferencing tele-mental health research, Clin Psychol (New York), 16, pp. 323-338, (2009); Simpson S.G., Reid C.L., Therapeutic alliance in videoconferencing psychotherapy : a review, Aust J Rural Heal, 22, pp. 280-299, (2014); Cowan K.E., McKean A.J., Gentry M.T., Et al., Barriers to use of telepsychiatry: clinicians as gatekeepers, Mayo Clin Proc, 94, pp. 2510-2523, (2019); Hilty D.M., Sunderji N., Suo S., Et al., Telepsychiatry and other technologies for integrated care: evidence base, best practice models and competencies, Int Rev Psychiatry, 30, pp. 292-309, (2018); Egede L.E., Acierno R., Knapp R.G., Et al., Psychotherapy for depression in older veterans via telemedicine: a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial, Lancet Psychiatry, 2, pp. 693-701, (2015); O'Reilly R., Bishop J., Maddox K., Et al., Is telepsychiatry equivalent to face-to-face psychiatry?

As healthcare systems are pivoting to value-based systems, intelligent and interactive analysis of health data is gaining significance for health system management, especially for resource optimization whilst improving care quality and health outcomes. Health data analytics is being influenced by new concepts and intelligent methods emanating from artificial intelligence and big data. In this article, we contextualize health data and health data analytics in terms of the emerging trends of artificial intelligence and big data. We examine the nature of health data using the big data criterion to understand “how big” is health data. Next, we explain the working of artificial intelligence–based data analytics methods and discuss “what insights” can be derived from a broad spectrum of health data analytics methods to improve health system management, health outcomes, knowledge discovery, and healthcare innovation. © 2019 The Canadian College of Health Leaders.","","Artificial Intelligence; Big Data; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Data Science; Decision Making, Computer-Assisted; article; artificial intelligence; big data; human; knowledge discovery; decision support system; statistical analysis","","","","","","","Porter M.E., Strategy for healthcare reform—toward a value-based system, N Engl J Med, 366, 2, pp. 109-112, (2009); Abidi S.S.R., Knowledge management in healthcare: towards ‘knowledge-driven’ decision-support services, Int J Med Inform, 63, 1-2, pp. 5-18, (2001); Gabriel S.E., Normand S.L., Getting the methods right—the foundation of patient-centered outcomes research, N Engl J Med, 367, 9, pp. 787-790, (2012); Roy P.C., Abidi S.R., Abidi S.S.R., Possibilistic activity recognition with uncertain observations to support medication adherence in an assisted ambient living setting, Knowl Based Syst, 133, c, pp. 156-173, (2017); Murdoch T.B., Detsky A.S., The inevitable application of big data to healthcare, JAMA, 309, 13, pp. 1351-1352, (2013); Obermeyer Z., Emanuel E.J., Predicting the future—big data, machine learning, and clinical medicine, N Engl J Med, 375, 13, pp. 1216-1219, (2016); Jiang F., Jiang Y., Zhi H., Et al., Artificial intelligence in healthcare: past, present and future, Stroke Vasc Neurol, 2, 4, pp. 230-243, (2017); Yang H., Kundakcioglu O.E., Li J., Wu T., Healthcare intelligence: turning data into knowledge, IEEE Intell Syst, 29, 3, pp. 54-68, (2014); Kureshi N., Abidi S.S.R., Blouin C., A predictive model for personalized therapeutic interventions in non-small cell lung cancer, IEEE J Biomed Health, 20, 1, pp. 424-431, (2016); Asadi H., Dowling R., Yan B., Mitchell P., Machine learning for outcome prediction of acute ischemic stroke post intra-arterial therapy, PLoS One, 9, 2, (2014); Fleming T.P., Watkins A.J., Velazquez M.A., Et al., Origins of lifetime health around the time of conception: causes and consequences, Lancet, 391, 10132, pp. 1842-1852, (2018); Abidi S.S.R., Roy P.C., Shah M.S., Yu J., Yan S., A data mining framework for glaucoma decision support based on optic nerve image analysis using machine learning methods, J Healthc Inform Res, 2, 4, pp. 370-401, (2018); Abidi S.R., A knowledge-modeling approach to integrate multiple clinical practice guidelines to provide evidence-based clinical decision support for managing comorbid conditions, J Med Syst, 41, 12, (2017); Abidi S.R., Cox J., Abusharekh A., Hashemian N., Abidi S.S.R., A digital health system to assist family physicians to safely prescribe NOAC medications, Stud Health Technol Inform, 228, pp. 519-523, (2016); Vindrola-Padros C., Vindrola-Padros B., Quick and dirty?

The flourishing health care technological landscape is showing great potential-from diagnosis and prescription automation to the early detection of disease through efficient and cost-effective patient data screening tools that benefit from the predictive capabilities of AI. Monitoring the trajectories of both in- A nd outpatients has proven to be a task AI can perform to a reliable degree. Predictions can be a significant advantage to health care if they are accurate, prompt, and can be personalized and acted upon efficiently. This is where AI plays a crucial role in ""Earlier Medicine"" implementation. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Methods To explore the foundational knowledge and research hotspots of big data research in the field of healthcare informatics, this study conducted a series of bibliometric analyses on the related literature, including papers’ production trends in the field and the trend of each paper's co-author number, the distribution of core institutions and countries, the core literature distribution, the related information of prolific authors and innovation paths in the field, a keyword co-occurrence analysis, and research hotspots and trends for the future. Results By conducting a literature content analysis and structure analysis, we found the following: (a) In the early stage, researchers from the United States, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and Germany made the most contributions to the literature associated with healthcare big data research and the innovation path in this field. (b) The innovation path in healthcare big data consists of three stages: the disease early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis phase, the life and health promotion phase, and the nursing phase. (c) Research hotspots are mainly concentrated in three dimensions: the disease dimension (e.g., epidemiology, breast cancer, obesity, and diabetes), the technical dimension (e.g., data mining and machine learning), and the health service dimension (e.g., customized service and elderly nursing). Conclusion This study will provide scholars in the healthcare informatics community with panoramic knowledge of healthcare big data research, as well as research hotspots and future research directions. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Bibliometrics; Big data; Healthcare informatics; Knowledge management; Knowledge structure","Bibliometrics; Biomedical Research; Data Mining; Databases as Topic; Humans; Medical Informatics; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Data visualization; Diagnosis; Diseases; Health care; Information management; Information science; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Nursing; Bibliometric analysis; Bibliometrics; Co-occurrence analysis; Future research directions; Health care informatics; Knowledge structures; Literature content analysis; People's Republic of China; bibliometrics; China; content analysis; data mining; early diagnosis; evolution; Germany; health care; health promotion; health service; human; knowledge base; knowledge management; machine learning; medical informatics; medical information; medical literature; medical research; nursing care; priority journal; prognosis; quality of life; Review; structure analysis; treatment planning; United Kingdom; United States; data base; procedures; Big data","","","","","China Social Science Foundation, (12&ZD221); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71271072, 71273125, 71301040, 71331002, 71573071)","The data collection, analysis, and interpretation of this research were partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under grant Nos. 71331002 , 71273125 , 71301040 , 71271072 and 71573071 , and by the China Social Science Foundation (major project program) under grant No. 12&ZD221 .","Khoury M.J., Ioannidis J.P., Big data meets public health, Science, 346, 6213, pp. 1054-1055, (2014); Mashey J.R., Big Data and the Next Wave of Infrastress.

If the viral outbreak has exposed gross inadequacies in the healthcare systems of nations both rich and poor, it has stirred a digital healthcare revolution that has been building since the past decade. We have seen how this new era of digital health evolved over the years since healthcare started getting increasingly unaffordable in the western countries forcing a relook in their strategies to explosion of digital innovations in mobile telephony and applications, internet, wearable devices, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data and genomics. The single biggest trigger for the digital shift has indeed been the COVID-19 pandemic this year, more so in India with astonishing response from the private enterprise and the proactive push from the government so evident. However, the full potential of this digital revolution cannot be realized as long as core structural reforms in public healthcare do not take place along with significant boost in digital infrastructure. The way digital technologies have helped facilitate strategy and response to the global pandemic and with predictions of more zoonotic outbreaks impending in the coming years, it has become imperative for the world to increasingly adopt and integrate digital innovations to make healthcare more accessible, interconnected and affordable. © 2020, Indian Institute of Science.","","Artificial intelligence; Health care; Digital infrastructures; Digital innovations; Digital revolution; Digital technologies; Health-care system; Private enterprise; Public healthcares; Western countries; Digital devices","","","","","","","Saad L., More Americans Delaying Medical Treatment due to Cost, (2019); McDermott J., Top 15 Most Expensive Countries to Be Hospitalized in World.

Healthcare is undergoing a transformation, and it is imperative to leverage new technologies to generate new data and support the advent of precision medicine (PM). Recent scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements have improved our disease knowledge and altered diagnosis and treatment approaches resulting in a more precise, predictive, preventative and personalized health care that is customized for the individual patient. Consequently, the big data revolution has provided an opportunity to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to mine such a vast data set. Additionally, personalized medicine promises to revolutionize healthcare, with its key goal of providing the right treatment to the right patient at the right time and dose, and thus the potential of improving quality of life and helping to bring down healthcare costs. This policy briefing will look in detail at the issues surrounding continued development, sustained investment, risk factors, testing and approval of innovations for better strategy and faster process. The paper will serve as a policy bridge that is required to enhance a conscious decision among the powers-that-be in Qatar in order to find a way to harmonize multiple strands of activity and responsibility in the health arena. The end goal will be for Qatar to enhance public awareness and engagement and to integrate effectively the incredible advances in research into healthcare systems, for the benefit of all patients. The PM policy briefing provides concrete recommendations on moving forward with PM initiatives in Qatar and internationally. Equally important, integration of PM within a primary care setting, building a coalition of community champions through awareness and advocacy, finally, communicating PM value, patient engagement/empowerment and education/continued professional development programs of the healthcare workforce. Key recommendations for implementation of precision medicine inside and outside Qatar:1.Create Community Awareness and PM Education Programs2.Engage and Empower Patients3.Communicate PM Value4.Develop appropriate Infrastructure and Information Management Systems5.Integrate PM into standard Healthcare System and Ensure Access to Care PM is no longer futuristic. It is here. Implementing PM in routine clinical care does require some investment and infrastructure development. Invariably, cost and lack of expertise are cited as barriers to PM implementation. Equally consequential, are the curriculum and professional development of medical care experts. Policymakers need to lead and coordinate effort among stakeholders and consider cultural and faith perspectives to ensure success. It is essential that policymakers integrate PM approaches into national strategies to improve health and health care for all, and to drive towards the future of medicine precision health. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cancer; Evidence-based research; Healthcare research; National policy; Population genomics; Precision medicine; Primary care; Public health policy","Health Policy; Humans; Precision Medicine; Qatar; health care policy; human; personalized medicine; Qatar","","","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH; Wellcome Trust, WT","The global promise of PM cannot be achieved if data being produced does not represent the human populations from various geographies and ethnicities.

Though many of these changes are just being felt due to resistance by organizations and individuals reluctant to change the status quo, the explosive growth of digital technology globally means that these changes are inevitable. We can expect to see increasing use of telemedicine for remote diagnostics and treatment, protocol-driven health care to improve quality of care, and better access to goods and services through changes in the organization of transportation and delivery services. Data will become central to health systems, whether big data and artificial intelligence tools for surveillance, planning, and management or “personalized data” in the form of universal electronic record systems and customized treatment protocols. As with any disruptive innovation, the growth of digital health will also bring challenges, including who owns, controls, and manages the data being collected and how to maintain privacy and confidentiality in this data-rich world. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","digital health; health systems technology","Developing Countries; Electronic Health Records; Global Health; Health Personnel; Humans; Internet Access; Telemedicine; developing country; education; electronic health record; global health; health care personnel; human; telemedicine","","","","","","","Definitive data and analysis for the mobile industry, (2019); Pouschter J., Stewart R., Smartphone ownership and Internet usage continues to climb in emerging economies but advanced economies still have higher rates of technology use, (2016); Battle J.D., Farrow L., Tibaijuka J., Mitchell M., MHealth for safer deliveries: A mixed methods evaluation of the effect of an integrated mobile health intervention on maternal care utilization, Healthcare, 3, 4, pp. 180-184, (2015); Republic of South Africa: praekelt foundation, (2017); Labrique A.B., Vasudevan L., Kochi E., Fabricant R., Mehl G., MHealth innovations as health system strengthening tools: 12 common applications and a visual framework, Global Health: Sci Pract, 1, 2, pp. 160-171, (2013); WHO developing guidelines for recommendations on digital health interventions for RMNCAH and health systems strengthening, (2019); Connecting the Next four billion: strengthening the global response for universal Internet access, (2017); Barron P., Peter J., Lefevre A.E., Sebid J., Bekker M., Allen R., Parsons A.N., Benjamin P., Pillay Y., Mobile health messaging service and helpdesk for South African mothers (MomConnect): history, successes and challenges, BMJ Glob Health, 3, (2013); Singh A.K., BBC media action, (2015); Rambaud-Althaus C., Shao A., Samaka J., Swai N., Perri S., Kahama-Maro J., Mitchell M., D'Acremont V., Genton B., Performance of health workers using an electronic algorithm for the management of childhood illness in Tanzania: A pilot implementation study, Am J Trop Med Hyg, 96, 1, pp. 249-257, (2016); Mitchell M., Hedt-Gauthier B.L., Msellemu D., Nkaka M., Lesh N., Using electronic technology to improve clinical care–results from a before-after cluster trial to evaluate assessment and classification of sick children according to Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) protocol in Tanzania, BMC Med Inform Decis Mak, 13, 1, (2013); Perri-Moore S., Routen T., Shao A.F., Rambaud-Althaus C., Swai N., Kahama-Maro J., D'Acremont V., Blaise G., Mitchell M., Using an eIMCI-derived decision support protocol to improve provider–caretaker communication for treatment of children under 5 in Tanzania, Global Health Commun, 1, 1, pp. 41-47, (2015); Agarwal S., Lasway C., L'Engle K., Homan R., Layer E., Ollis S., Braun R., Silas L., Mwakibete A., Kudrati M., Family planning counseling in your pocket: A mobile job aid for community health workers in Tanzania, Global Health: Sci Pract, 4, 2, pp. 300-310, (2016); Mitchell M., Lesh N., Cranmer H., Fraser H., Haivas I., Wolf K., Improving care–improving access: the use of electronic decision support with AIDS patients in South Africa, Int J Healthcare Technol Manage, 10, 3, (2009); Dias D., Cunha J.P., Wearable health devices—vital sign monitoring, systems and technologies, Sensors, 18, 8, (2018); Bashshur R.L., Howell J.D., Krupinski E.A., Harms K.M., Bashshur N., Doarn C.R., The empirical foundations of telemedicine interventions in primary care, Telemedicine E-Health, 22, 5, pp. 342-375, (2016); Siwicki B., Biometrics entering a new era in healthcare, Healthcare IT News, (2018); Zuniga A.E., Win K.T., Susilo W., Biometrics for electronic health records, J Med Syst, 34, 5, pp. 975-983, (2010); What is Aadhaar, (2019); D-tree international uses mobile technology to ensure safe deliveries, (2017); Richter R., Jain S., India’s medical miracle.

Recent advances in technological innovations and genetics and the growing availability of health data have set a new pace of the research and impose a set of new requirements on the different stakeholders. Some studies are available that discuss about the different aspects of PM. Nevertheless, a holistic representation of those aspects deemed to confer with the technological perspective, in relation to the applications and challenges, have been mostly ignored. In this context, this paper surveys the advances in PM from the informatics viewpoint and reviews the enabling tools and techniques in a categorized manner. In addition, the study discusses how other technological paradigms, which include big data, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things, can be exploited to advance the potentials of PM. Furthermore, the paper provides some guidelines for future research for a seamless implementation and a wide-scale deployment of PM based on the identified open issues and the associated challenges. As a result, the paper proposes an integrated holistic framework for PM motivating informatics researchers to design their relevant research work in an appropriate context. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; big data; bioinformatics; clinical decision support; deep learning; informatics; machine learning; Precision medicine; the Internet of Things","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Bioinformatics; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Informatics; Internet of things; Learning systems; Medicine; Personalized medicine; Clinical decision support; Enabling tools; Health data; Holistic frameworks; Medical practice; Paper surveys; Technological innovation; Technological perspective; Medical informatics","","","","","European pharmaceutical industry; Information Technology Research Center, (IITP-2017-0-01629); European Commission, EC; National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC; Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Department of Health, Government of Western Australia; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP, (2017-0-00655, NRF-2019R1A2C2090504); Innovative Medicines Initiative, IMI","Funding text 1: The European Union (EU) is putting forward numerous efforts to promote precision medicine in the European region. As the world’s biggest public-private partnership between the EU and the European pharmaceutical industry, the Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI) facilitates collaborations between the stakeholders and provides grants and other financial support to major research projects [143]. The IMI in phase 2, which is the IMI 2 program (2014-2020), will get a total budget of e3.276 billion, which e1 billion came from the Health theme of the EU’s Seventh Framework Program for Research (FP7) and e1 billion came from in-kind contributions from EFPIA companies [144]. According to a report by ZION, the European precision medicine market is expected to reach approximately USD 72,800 Million by 2022 [145]. Under EU’s Horizon 2020 Program, Barcelona has started the European three-dimensional (3D) genomics project Multi-scale complex genomics with a goal to standardize experiments in 3D genomics and relevant activities, such as the storage of data. The project is allocated a budget of e3 million and will be conducted over three years [146]. The EU funded project PerMed, which is where representatives from EU Member States in conjunction with other associated countries and stakeholders, have developed a European strategy framework for personalized medicine [6]. PerMed [147] is the coordination and support action (CSA) of 27 partners that include European key stakeholders and decision makers to allow synergies, avoid duplication, and ensure maximum transparency for preparing Europe to lead the global way [148]. The International Consortium for Personalized Medicine (ICPerMed) is a voluntary EU Member states-led collaboration that brings together over 30 European and international partners to work on coordinating and fostering research to develop and evaluate personalized medicine [6], [149].; Funding text 2: This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program under Grant IITP-2017-0-01629, and in part by the Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion (IITP), through the Korea Government (MSIT) under Grant 2017-0-00655 and Grant NRF-2019R1A2C2090504.; Funding text 3: Australia is perhaps the world’s first country to have a center specializing in precision medicine for infants and your children. It is funded at Murdoch University and has received $473,000 in funding from the WA Department of Health [150]. Precision medicine has the potential to transform Australia’s health care system, which was described in a report released by the Australian Council of Learning Academies (ACOLA) [151]. ACOLA has started a project on precision medicine with a goal to explore the current trends in precision medicine technologies and to broaden the implementation in the Australian context. In the ACOLA detailed report, there are 12 potential areas that are highlighted where precision medicine is likely to show significant impact in the next five to ten years [152]. Australian Genomics is a national network of clinicians, researchers, and diagnostic geneticists, and it is made up of more than 70 partners organizations with a vision to integrate genomic medicine into healthcare across Australia [153]. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) awarded a $25 million grant in 2015 to Australian Genomics for a targeted call for research into preparing Australia for the genomics revolution in healthcare.","Collins F.S., Varmus H., A new initiative on precision medicine, New England J.

This review principally attempts to heighten the awareness of newer emerging paradigms that may advance acquisition, visualization and interpretation of the large functional data sets obtained during cardiac ultrasound imaging. Incorporation of innovative cognitive software that allow advanced pattern recognition and disease forecasting will likely transform the human-machine interface and interpretation process to achieve a more efficient and effective work environment. Novel technologies for automation and big data analytics that are already active in other fields need to be rapidly adapted to the health care environment with new academic-industry collaborations to enrich and accelerate the delivery of newer decision making tools for enhancing patient care. © 2013 By The American College of Cardiology Foundation.","big data; cognitive computing; echocardiography; parametric imaging; robotics","Artificial Intelligence; Automation, Laboratory; Diffusion of Innovation; Echocardiography; Forecasting; Heart Diseases; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Severity of Illness Index; Software; big data; cognitive computing; echocardiography; parametric imaging; robotics; article; automation; cardiac imaging; diseases; echocardiography; functional assessment; fuzzy system; human; Internet; man machine interaction; medical care; medical information system; patient decision making; pattern recognition; priority journal; robotics; work environment","","","","","Forest Laboratories","Dr. Sengupta has received research funding from Forest Laboratories; and is on the advisory board for Medical Intelligence Ltd.
